0:21
- Hello!
0:23

0:29
Hello, New Orleans, how are you?
0:32
- [cheering and applause]
0:36
- Oh, I'm so glad to be back in the South
0:38
where people are real. - WOMAN: Yeah!
0:40
- AUDIENCE: [cheering] - And the men are beautiful.
0:43
- AUDIENCE: [cheering] - Yes.
0:45
'Cause I was forced to move to New York because of success.
0:48
- AUDIENCE: [laughing]
0:53
- [fake crying] And I hate that place.
0:55
- AUDIENCE: [laughing]
0:57
- ♪ I hate that place ♪
1:00
I hate that place! I hate it!
1:03
I hate it! Okay?
1:06
You're not allowed to say that.
1:08
You're not allowed to say you hate New York.
1:09
'Cause people go, "What do you mean you hate New York?
1:11
It's the greatest city on earth." What?
1:15
And they always do it the same way,
1:16
they always look slightly off to the side
1:18
like a cult member.
1:19
"It's the greatest city on earth." What?
1:21
- AUDIENCE: [laughing]
1:22
- Where did you go? I'm right here, what happened?
1:25
- AUDIENCE: [laughing]
1:26
- Is De Blasio paying you? What's going on?
1:28
- AUDIENCE: [laughing]
1:29
- I hate that place.
1:31
It's a Yankee trash heap, I hate it.
1:33
- AUDIENCE: [laughing]
1:35
- This is my purpose in life, this is my ministry to tell you.
1:38
- AUDIENCE: [laughing]
1:40
- It's horrible. - AUDIENCE: [laughing]
1:43
- When they say to you, "It's the greatest city on earth,"
1:45
I go, "Prove it."
1:47
Like, "Oh, uh...the museums!" What?
1:51
- AUDIENCE: [laughing]
1:53
- "The museums--the museums are amazing,
1:55
you can go to a museum every day."
1:56
I can't go to a museum every day, I got a job.
1:58
- AUDIENCE: [laughing]
2:00
- "Well--well, the restaurants, the restaurants are amazing."
2:02
I can't go to your fancy restaurants and quit my job
2:04
to go to museums.
2:06
- AUDIENCE: [laughing]
2:08
- And it's so cold.
2:10
- AUDIENCE: [laughing]
2:14
- [fake crying] It's so cold. - AUDIENCE: [laughing]
2:18
- And just to know something about me, just emotionally,
2:20
spiritually, genetically, historically,
2:22
I'm never supposed to be cold.
2:24
- AUDIENCE: [laughing]
2:26
[cheering and applause]
2:32
- So to live somewhere... [fake crying] that gets so cold.
2:35
- AUDIENCE: [laughing]
2:37
- Like, last year it snowed, it was a blizzard,
2:40
but they called it a bomb cyclone.
2:42
- AUDIENCE: [laughing]
2:44
- A cyclone is a hurricane in the South Pacific,
2:47
and a bomb is a damn bomb.
2:49
- AUDIENCE: [laughing]
2:53
- Why are we all of a sudden confused
2:54
as to what's happening out here?
2:56
- AUDIENCE: [laughing]
2:58
- So it happened on a Wednesday and they told me
3:00
I still had to go to work-- wait a minute.
3:03
There's frozen water on the ground.
3:05
Jesus don't want me to go to work.
3:07
- AUDIENCE: [laughing]
3:09
- Why I got to do this? What you talking about? Okay.
3:12
And they're like, "Oh, you can still take the train,"
3:13
no, no, no, no, no. Mm-mm.
3:17
It was seven degrees outside.
3:20
As the high.
3:21
- AUDIENCE: [laughing]
3:23
- Those were all the degrees we was gonna get that day.
3:25
- AUDIENCE: [laughing]
3:26
[applause]
3:29
- And you want me to get on this train?
3:31
I live where the above ground train is,
3:32
I don't know what these frigid temperatures will do
3:34
to rail lines, I was a theater major, not an engineer.
3:36
- AUDIENCE: [laughing]
3:39
- So I get on this frozen train and it jumps the tracks
3:40
and all of a sudden I'm in a Final Destination movie,
3:42
absolutely not.
3:44
- AUDIENCE: [laughing] [applause]
3:47
- So then, fine, I'll take a car.
3:49
And I stand outside in the seven degrees
3:52
freezing my eggs.
3:53
- AUDIENCE: [laughing]
3:58
- Trying to get to work and I snapped,
4:00
because it was seven degrees outside, but the sun was out.
4:04
- AUDIENCE: [laughing]
4:05
- Mocking me. - AUDIENCE: [laughing]
4:08
- Like a lamp in the damn sky.
4:10
- AUDIENCE: [laughing]
4:11
- And I snapped, I just looked up, like,
4:13
"You got a billion degrees and you can't give me 50?!
4:15
Go to hell!" I was like, "You know what?"
4:17
- AUDIENCE: [laughing]
4:19
- Then I realized I was a black lady in a white neighborhood
4:21
yelling at the sun...
4:22
- AUDIENCE: [laughing]
4:25
- Like, you know what? Let me go inside,
4:26
'cause if you call the cops on me, I earned it, I earned it.
4:29
- AUDIENCE: [laughing] - They show up, like,
4:31
"Officer, please take me somewhere warm."
4:33
- AUDIENCE: [laughing] - "I hate this place."
4:36
- AUDIENCE: [laughing] - 'Cause the thing is,
4:38
I'm not supposed to be here.
4:41
Black people! - [cheering and applause]
4:46
- We not supposed to be here. - AUDIENCE: [laughing]
4:49
- Suffering. Through--through scarves
4:52
and hats and boots and gloves, no.
4:55
We supposed to be in West Africa with sandals on eating mangoes,
4:58
that's where we supposed to be.
4:59
- AUDIENCE: [cheering and applause]
5:03
- Instead of suffering with these melanin-lacking bastards.
5:06
- AUDIENCE: [laughing]
5:10
- It's too cold, man.
5:13
There's too many humans in New York.
5:16
There's too many humans.
5:18
Eight and a half million people
5:21
live in 300 square miles.
5:25
Why? - AUDIENCE: [laughing]
5:27
- If you break that down, that's 27,000 people per mile.
5:33
How do you live? - AUDIENCE: [laughing]
5:35
- Who's idea was this? - AUDIENCE: [laughing]
5:39
- Y'all just strapped two islands together
5:40
with some bridges, was like, "All y'all got to see this!"
5:43
No.
5:45
- AUDIENCE: [laughing]
5:50
- And God forbid one of these Yankees finds out
5:52
I'm not from New York.
5:53
"Oh, you're not from New York?"
5:55
They all sound like witches to me.
5:56
"You're not from New York?" - AUDIENCE: [laughing]
6:00
- "What do you mean you're not from New York?"
6:02
- That by the grace of God, I was not born here, thank you.
6:05
- AUDIENCE: [laughing]
6:07
[cheering and applause]
6:09
- "Where are you from?" Atlanta, you're welcome.
6:11
- AUDIENCE: [cheering] - "But, oh, you must be so glad
6:14
"to be in New York, the South is so racist,
6:16
the South is so racist." Oh.
6:19
You mean the part of the South that starts at Canada
6:21
and ends at Mexico?
6:22
- AUDIENCE: [cheering and applause]
6:32
- Find me a part of the map that's not racist,
6:34
I'll move today.
6:36
I'll wait.
6:39
I know the North is more racist 'cause in the North,
6:41
they split up white folks. - WOMAN: [cheers]
6:44
- They got Italian neighborhoods,
6:46
Irish neighborhoods, I live in a Greek neighborhood.
6:51
You know what Irish and Italian and Greek is in the South?
6:55
White! - AUDIENCE: [laughing]
6:59
- Nobody has time to break down your brand of whiteness, okay?!
7:02
- AUDIENCE: [laughing] - I don't care what flag
7:05
your Caucasian flies under, Brandon!
7:08
- AUDIENCE: [laughing]
7:12
- Don't--sit the hell down, what do you want from me?
7:18
- AUDIENCE: [laughing]
7:19
- I used to live in LA 'cause Jesus loves me.
7:21
- AUDIENCE: [laughing]
7:23
- But the problem is when I moved to LA
7:24
I didn't see more than five black people
7:26
on the first three months and I was like, "Okay.
7:29
I've seen TV. I know they out here."
7:32
- AUDIENCE: [laughing]
7:34
- "Where'd you put 'em?" - AUDIENCE: [laughing]
7:37
- But I didn't know I was the one in the wrong. Right?
7:39
I lived in East LA, I lived in Highland Park.
7:42
And I lived in a Mexican-American neighborhood
7:44
that was quickly getting gentrified,
7:46
so they were confused what my black ass was doing there.
7:48
- AUDIENCE: [laughing]
7:50
- So I got tías and dudes in buns
7:51
looking real suspicious at me.
7:54
I'm like, "Hey, man, I'm just here for nachos,
7:55
I don't want no problems." - AUDIENCE: [laughing]
7:59
- And then, I speak Spanish, so the Mexicans thought
8:01
I was a spy, I'm like, "Nah, man,
8:04
I'm just trying to get hooked up on these nachos."
8:06
- AUDIENCE: [laughing]
8:09
- And there's this one Lyft driver I used to get
8:11
all the time.
8:13
And one day, I guess he had had it, 'cause I got in the car
8:15
and he was like, "Dulce?" "Yeah?"
8:19
"Where you from?" "Atlanta."
8:23
"Nah...where's your mom from?"
8:26
- AUDIENCE: [laughing]
8:28
- "Miami." "Nah.
8:32
Where's your grandma from?" Dude, take me home!
8:34
- AUDIENCE: [laughing]
8:37
- I'm not here for your Lyft 23 and Me, Jorge,
8:39
take me the hell home, dawg!
8:41
- AUDIENCE: [laughing]
8:44
- You wanna crack this mystery? I got a Spanish name
8:47
'cause my mama grew up in Miami,
8:48
the only Spanish she knows is food and my name is food, okay?
8:51
- AUDIENCE: [laughing]
8:58
[cheering and applause]
9:06
- I finally did see a black lady, I was in Target,
9:08
we saw each other and went, "Ooh!"
9:10
Don't do that when you see us, it's rude.
9:12
- AUDIENCE: [laughing]
9:15
- So we went, "Ooh!" And I was like, "What up, auntie?"
9:17
'Cause she was a auntie and... I walked right up to her,
9:20
"Hey, auntie, uh, quick question.
9:24
Where are the rest of us?"
9:26
- AUDIENCE: [laughing]
9:28
- And she was like, "Oh, girl, you in the wrong neighborhood,
9:30
you gotta go to, like, Compton, or Inglewood,"
9:32
I was like "Ooh, ooh, ooh.
9:36
Um, I'm second-generation suburbs, uh..."
9:39
- AUDIENCE: [laughing]
9:46
- "I don't wanna go to hood movie places
9:47
"to see black people.
9:49
Where the brunching Negroes at?"
9:51
- AUDIENCE: [laughing] [applause]
9:58
- "I'm a mimosa [bleep] myself, where..."
10:01
- AUDIENCE: [laughing]
10:06
- And she was like, "Brunch? What's brunch?"
10:08
I was like, "Bitch, we're in Target."
10:09
- AUDIENCE: [laughing]
10:12
- "That is a Walmart question, how dare you?"
10:13
- AUDIENCE: [laughing]
10:16
- "People have shoes on, what are you doing?"
10:18
- AUDIENCE: [laughing] [applause]
10:24
- [sighs] I'm single. Which is confusing.
10:29
- WOMAN: Good! - No, it's not.
10:30
- AUDIENCE: [laughing]
10:34
- 'Cause I have boobs big enough
10:35
for each of them to have their own boyfriend.
10:37
- AUDIENCE: [laughing]
10:41
- If you want big titties, go to church, that's what I did.
10:44
These Gs came from Jesus, you're welcome. Listen.
10:47
- AUDIENCE: [laughing]
10:48
- I get real confused 'cause I'm like, "Men love titties."
10:51
Right? - AUDIENCE: [laughing]
10:53
- And they love a big ass, I have both of those.
10:55
So I'm like, alright "Two, plus two,equals married."
10:59
- AUDIENCE: [laughing]
11:02
- Yeah, it's weird to get up in the morning and be beautiful
11:04
and single and be like, "What the [bleep] is happening?"
11:07
And it did hit me real hard 'cause I'm in my 30s,
11:09
don't tell my manager, I'm in my 30s.
11:11
- AUDIENCE: [laughing]
11:14
- And my best friend, she tried to warn me,
11:16
she was like, "Listen, when you turn 30,
11:17
your body's gonna freak out,"
11:18
and I was like, "Lies, bitch, lies."
11:21
And then I turned 30, and my biological clock
11:24
went from snooze to European techno.
11:27
- AUDIENCE: [laughing]
11:30
- So now every time I see a child I just hear
11:32
"Bah, bah, have a baby, bam, it's awesome,
11:34
bam, and I love you--" wait a minute.
11:38
I've things to do today, okay?
11:41
Are there any women here in their 20s?
11:43
- WOMEN: [cheering]
11:45
- Alright, let me talk to y'all for a second,
11:48
'cause I...nobody told me, you have to listen to me,
11:51
I'm a black woman, that's why Oprah's a billionaire, okay?
11:53
You have to listen to me. Oprah's the only reason
11:55
white women read, let's talk about that.
11:57
So... - AUDIENCE: [laughing]
12:00
- I need to tell you something 'cause nobody tried to warn me
12:02
and I didn't wanna listen, nobody told me,
12:04
so I'm trying to help you out, I want you all to know,
12:06
you've never been horny before.
12:08
- AUDIENCE: [laughing]
12:09
- I'm telling you right now, they didn't tell me, alright?
12:13
You know what that silence is? Every woman in her 30s
12:16
going, "Tell these bitches the truth."
12:18
- AUDIENCE: [laughing]
12:21
- Nobody told me.
12:24
Because I don't wanna have sex, I wanna mate,
12:27
that's a completely different part of your brain. Okay?
12:32
You don't think I didn't walk in here and figured out
12:34
at least five dudes I wanna bang before this special's over?
12:37
You're crazy hot, sir, I'm not kidding!
12:39
- AUDIENCE: [laughing]
12:43
- What up, green shirt? This is not a joke!
12:46
- AUDIENCE: [laughing]
12:50
[cheering and applause]
12:54
- Glasses, what's up? Listen, I am not playing with y'all!
12:56
Okay? 'Cause I wake up every morning and my body goes,
13:00
"Give me a baby!" I'm like, "Man, I gotta go to work today."
13:02
- AUDIENCE: [laughing]
13:04
- "Give me a baby." I gotta catch a flight not a fetus.
13:06
No, I can't. - AUDIENCE: [laughing]
13:09
- "Give me a baby!" Listen, I need a child 'cause I look
13:11
like the mother of three since I was 15 years old, okay?
13:13
- AUDIENCE: [laughing]
13:14
- And I'm not saying that to be messed up,
13:16
I've had huge boobs and this body--I look like somebody
13:19
should be asking me questions on a regular basis,
13:21
that's all I'm saying.
13:22
- AUDIENCE: [laughing]
13:25
- I'm so serious about this, I don't see married men anymore.
13:29
If I see a man and there's a ring on his finger, pfft,
13:32
don't see him. - AUDIENCE: [laughing]
13:34
- It becomes the outline of a human, Peter Pan's shadow.
13:37
- AUDIENCE: [laughing]
13:40
- Why do I need to see the face of a dick I can't use?
13:42
That's stupid. - AUDIENCE: [laughing]
13:44
[cheering and applause]
13:50
- I was in New York and a married man came up to me
13:52
and asked for directions and I went, "Tell your wife!"
13:54
He didn't need that. - AUDIENCE: [laughing]
13:58
- He was lost in New York, he just wanted help.
14:01
But then I looked down at his phone and I saw
14:02
that the Maps app was open. What?
14:06
Sir. I don't know more than a satellite.
14:10
- AUDIENCE: [laughing]
14:12
- I might be a big bitch, but I don't orbit the Earth,
14:14
call your wife!
14:16
- AUDIENCE: [laughing]
14:20
- Very serious about this. I'm a problem, okay?
14:24
Y'all remember that movie, "The Predator"?
14:27
That he would see a target and the numbers would come up
14:29
on the side?
14:31
That's what I'm doing, 'cause now I look at men
14:33
like men look at women, I'm a problem.
14:36
- AUDIENCE: [laughing]
14:38
- It's what I do all day, see a dude, "Oh he's kinda cute,
14:40
"oh, he's got a nice outfit, wait, is he [unintelligible],
14:43
beat it, you, over here."
14:45
- AUDIENCE: [laughing]
14:50
- "Oh, he's kinda cute for a dude with skinny jeans,
14:52
"wait, is he paying for PVR for wet money?
14:54
Broke, no, I'm not doing this." - AUDIENCE: [laughing]
14:58
- I gotta be careful 'cause my mama told me
15:00
if I come home with ugly grandkids,
15:01
she ain't messing with 'em.
15:03
- AUDIENCE: [laughing] - I got a black mama, okay?
15:07
She said, "I'll put hats on the martians and send them back,
15:09
do not play with me." - AUDIENCE: [laughing]
15:12
- 'Cause I'm out here, on the road,
15:15
touching men to see if they have a strong back.
15:17
- AUDIENCE: [laughing]
15:20
- And I don't know what that means.
15:22
- AUDIENCE: [laughing]
15:24
- I'm in heat, y'all understand the difference?
15:26
- AUDIENCE: [laughing]
15:31
- I can say the only thing that's good about
15:33
living in New York,
15:35
is I'm trying to get me one of these fine Jewish menses.
15:38
- [cheering and applause]
15:40
- I don't know why.
15:41
I don't know why. I can't tell you.
15:42
Maybe it's 'cause I love the Lord.
15:44
I don't know. - AUDIENCE: [laughing]
15:47
- Okay?
15:48
'Cause Old Testament God is my favorite God,
15:50
'cause he played no games. - AUDIENCE: [laughing]
15:55
- "I told y'all stop doing this dumb sh--I told you--
15:56
"you know what? Flood the Earth!
15:57
Try me again. Try me again."
15:59
- AUDIENCE: [laughing] [applause]
16:04
- Old Testament God is a black parent, so I understand.
16:06
- AUDIENCE: [laughing]
16:09
- Or maybe it's 'cause I wanna know what happens
16:10
when an Afro and a Jewfro meet. - AUDIENCE: [laughing]
16:16
- And I wanna see the beautiful head of hair
16:17
that will exfoliate me as I give birth.
16:20
- AUDIENCE: [laughing]
16:30
- When I truly think about it, right?
16:32
When I truly get into it, get truly in touch
16:34
with what's going on in here.
16:38
It's really 'cause they're circumcised.
16:40
- AUDIENCE: [laughing] - As a rule.
16:43
You never think you're gonna catch one that's not,
16:45
'cause that's just how they do it, right?
16:47
- AUDIENCE: [laughing] - 'Cause I don't know
16:48
if anyone here has ever had the misfortune...
16:51
- AUDIENCE: [laughing]
16:52
- ...of seeing an uncircum-- Hmm...
16:54
- AUDIENCE: [laughing] - [exhales]
16:59
- [laughing continues]
17:02
- Of seeing an uncircumcised dick, oh, God.
17:05
- AUDIENCE: [laughing]
17:09
- Every time I see one I'm like,
17:10
"Sir, why did your parents hate me?"
17:12
- AUDIENCE: [laughing]
17:14
- "Why am I rolling this dick down like gym socks,
17:16
who sent you?" - AUDIENCE: [laughing]
17:19
- It's a dick or a burrito to go, what's happening, sir?!
17:22
- AUDIENCE: [laughing]
17:26
- 'Cause they out in New York, you know, they're like
17:28
cage-free, free-range, out and about.
17:30
- AUDIENCE: [laughing]
17:31
- In your coffee shop, writing screenplays, you know.
17:34
- AUDIENCE: [laughing]
17:35
- I didn't interact with a lot of Jews growing up
17:37
'cause I grew up in Atlanta so they kept themselves
17:39
in a safe place.
17:40
- AUDIENCE: [laughing]
17:41
- So all I really have to go off of is, you know,
17:43
curly hair, dark features, and anxiety.
17:45
- AUDIENCE: [laughing]
17:48
- So I've been playing this fun game in New York
17:49
I like to call "Jewish or Italian"
17:51
'cause I don't know. - AUDIENCE: [laughing]
17:55
- 'Cause you know, I'll be out and about,
17:56
you know at bars and stuff, 'cause apparently
17:58
that's where men go. - AUDIENCE: [laughing]
18:01
- 'Cause I asked my homeboy, like, "Hey, I wanna meet a man."
18:03
He was like, "You gotta leave your house,"
18:04
and I was like, "Oh, no."
18:06
- AUDIENCE: [laughing]
18:08
- Did you know you can't meet the love of your life
18:09
in your house watching murder mysteries,
18:11
did you know that? - AUDIENCE: [laughing]
18:13
- 'Cause the Uber eats man is always married,
18:15
I can promise you that. - AUDIENCE: [laughing]
18:20
- So sometimes I'd be out and about at these bars, right?
18:22
I think I picked up God's chosen people,
18:25
and go home with him, 'cause I'm a lady.
18:28
- AUDIENCE: [laughing]
18:29
- And we get naked, 'cause that's how sex works.
18:32
- AUDIENCE: [laughing]
18:33
- And I'm standing there, you know, just...naked.
18:36
- AUDIENCE: [laughing]
18:38
- And I look over...
18:41
and his dick still has clothes on.
18:43
- AUDIENCE: [laughing]
18:49
[laughing continues]
18:53
- Curly hair. - AUDIENCE: [laughing]
18:56
- Dark features. Uncircumcised.
19:00
Tsk, this bastard's Italian. Dammit!
19:02
- AUDIENCE: [laughing]
19:06
- I gotta start asking for last names, that's on me.
19:09
- AUDIENCE: [laughing]
19:14
- This is the thing, y'all. I want children, okay?
19:17
I want children, I want a husband,
19:19
I want all of these things.
19:21
- AUDIENCE: [laughing]
19:24
- 'Cause what I really want, I want beautiful daughters
19:26
and I want giant sons.
19:29
- MAN: [cheering]
19:30
- I'm talking about six years old playing varsity football.
19:34
- AUDIENCE: [laughing] - Giant!
19:37
[bleep] sons.
19:40
Already told y'all the problem with that.
19:43
I like Jewish dudes. - AUDIENCE: [laughing]
19:48
- So how do you make that baby?
19:51
- AUDIENCE: [laughing]
19:52
- I'm gon' make Drake.
19:53
- AUDIENCE: [laughter and applause]
19:58
- I'm gonna make Degrassi Drake.
20:00
- AUDIENCE: [laughing]
20:01
- The weakest of all the damn Drakes!
20:04
- AUDIENCE: [laughing] [applause]
20:09
- [sighs]
20:11

20:13
- [cheering and applause]
