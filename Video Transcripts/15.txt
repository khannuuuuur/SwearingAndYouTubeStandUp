- Surprise!
0:49
Sheng Wang is Chinese.
0:52
(audience cheering)
0:55
What's up, everybody?
0:56
Thank you so much for being here.
0:58
My name is Sheng Wang,
0:59
sometimes when I tell people that, they're like,
1:02
"Wow, that is perfect for pursuing standup comedy."
1:09
I'm like, "Yeah, but first
1:11
I was trying to pursue childhood."
1:13
(audience laughing)
1:16
You know it's tough when kids call you names.
1:20
It's always worse when they just use your name.
1:23
(audience laughing)
1:28
Even recently, I was making a reservation
1:30
for this hotel in Arkansas,
1:32
I gave the guy information, it was all good,
1:34
I told him my name is Sheng Wang.
1:35
He said, "That's funny, you don't sound like that."
1:41
(audience laughing)
1:44
I was like, "My bad,
1:46
"I'm sorry if I don't meet your racist expectations."
1:52
I'm sorry if I don't sound like
1:54
a complete stereotype, Arkansas.
1:56
(audience laughing)
1:57
You, on the other hand, are doing a really good job.
2:00
(audience laughing)
2:02
(audience applauding)
2:09
I'm getting to this age
2:11
where I find myself comforting friends
2:13
'cause they're starting to trip
2:14
about losing their terf up top.
2:17
I'm a positive person,
2:19
to me going bald is not about hair loss,
2:22
it's about face gain.
2:24
(audience laughing)
2:26
It's not a receding hairline,
2:27
it's an advancing facial frontier.
2:30
(audience laughing)
2:32
It's exciting.
2:34
One day this will be my forehead.
2:37
(audience laughing)
2:39
Yeah, one day I'll have a whole head of face.
2:44
(audience laughing)
2:47
Most people have facial expressions right here.
2:50
Imagine utilizing all this,
2:52
that's a bigger canvas, convey more emotions, mostly sorrow.
2:59
(audience laughing)
3:03
If you can show me a man with a comb over,
3:05
I can show you a man who thinks
3:07
that by crushing a bag of chips, you make more chips.
3:11
(audience laughing)
3:13
(audience applauding)
3:19
Trying to be healthier these days,
3:20
eat more fruits and vegetables,
3:22
and I ate a pomegranate.
3:25
You guys ever had a pomegranate?
3:27
(audience applauding)
3:28
That is a magical fruit.
3:31
It's like juice corn.
3:32
(audience laughing)
3:34
It's like God got stoned one day
3:36
and he was like, you know what,
3:38
I'ma put some fruit juice inside these kernels.
3:41
Let's do that.
3:42
But I'm not gonna put it on the cob,
3:44
I'ma shove it up this fat, dirty radish.
3:46
(audience laughing)
3:56
I was hanging at my buddy's house, right,
3:59
and my friend hands me a hard-boiled egg as a snack.
4:05
But because it was sitting in the fridge over night
4:07
with all these leftovers,
4:08
the egg smelled like fried chicken.
4:11
(audience laughing)
4:13
But he didn't tell me what happened, right?
4:14
I got the egg, I was all confused,
4:16
I was like, (sniffing), yo, this egg,
4:24
this egg is an old soul.
4:26
(audience laughing)
4:30
Clearly ahead of its time,
4:32
it's not even hatched,
4:33
it already smells like a full-grown two-piece combo.
4:36
(audience laughing)
4:38
(audience applauding)
4:44
My favorite bar recently upgraded
4:47
their paper towel machines.
4:51
It used to be a simple lever,
4:52
you pull a lever real easy
4:54
and you get a paper towel,
4:55
and now they got a new motion sensor technology.
4:58
You don't have to touch it,
4:59
all you gotta do is...
5:03
(audience laughing)
5:05
What's up?
5:08
You gotta say hello to a robot that ignores you.
5:12
Right, nothing happens.
5:14
And I'm sure they're working on improvements,
5:15
but in the meantime, if you wanna dry your hands today,
5:17
you gotta really want it, you know?
5:18
You gotta figure it out.
5:21
(audience laughing)
5:26
You gotta put effort, a little back into it,
5:27
you gotta give it up.
5:29
(audience laughing)
5:33
(audience applauding)
5:45
By the time you get a paper towel,
5:46
there's like three dudes dancing behind you.
5:48
(audience laughing)
5:50
And then your night is different.
5:58
I took a dump in a toilet with no water.
6:01
(audience laughing)
6:04
I had to tell my friends,
6:06
yeah, I dropped the kids off at the skate park.
6:09
(audience laughing)
6:11
(audience applauding)
6:20
You guys know that on the front of an ambulance,
6:24
the word ambulance is written backwards,
6:27
so that when you see the reflection
6:28
in your rear-view mirror, it reads forwards.
6:32
Pretty good idea,
6:33
in case you ever happen to be doing an excellent job
6:37
of blocking a freaking ambulance,
6:40
and you need more information,
6:42
you gotta have it spelled out for you.
6:44
(audience laughing)
6:46
You're confused, you're like, what's going on?
6:49
What's happening outside?
6:50
Oh my god, it is so loud.
6:52
(audience laughing)
6:57
It is bright as hell.
7:00
Man, I better slow down and read the hood.
7:03
(audience laughing)
7:11
Yo, this ice cream truck is over the top.
7:14
(audience laughing)
7:17
Lcnalubma?
7:21
I don't know what flavor that is.
7:27
(audience applauding)
7:29
I was in the mid west last year,
7:31
I was driving from town to town
7:32
doing these college one nighters,
7:33
and one afternoon I'm on the highway,
7:36
I caught a very miraculous,
7:37
like a Discovery Channel moment.
7:40
I saw an eagle catch a snake for lunch.
7:46
I was so excited, I called up my friend,
7:48
I was like, "Dude, I just saw the Mexican flag
7:50
"live in Wisconsin."
7:52
(audience laughing)
7:57
It was beautiful.
8:00
I'm getting older.
8:01
I feel like I'm getting older
8:03
only because I got a lot of friends
8:05
that are starting to get married.
8:07
It's weird, 'cause a lot of my female friends,
8:09
I think they're very progressive liberal-minded folks,
8:11
but when it comes to the engagement ring,
8:13
they want a very traditional, big ass rock.
8:17
(audience laughing)
8:19
I understand ladies love diamonds
8:20
because diamonds are forever.
8:23
True, but so is a plastic bag.
8:27
(audience laughing)
8:30
(audience applauding)
8:38
Because my love is eternal,
8:42
because my love will never break down,
8:48
I wanna give you this non-biodegradable grocery sack.
8:52
Don't be sad, girl, it's got like 50 carrots in there.
8:56
(audience laughing)
8:58
(audience applauding)
9:06
I also know I'm getting older
9:08
because I was watching this MILF porn,
9:14
and it just seemed like regular porn.
9:17
(audience laughing)
9:19
(audience applauding)
9:22
MILFs used to look like my friend's mom,
9:26
now they just look like my friends,
9:30
which only adds to the ongoing peer pressure
9:32
to make me wanna settle down.
9:34
You know how weird it is to watch pornography
9:37
and think to yourself,
9:38
gosh, I guess it is time for me to start a family.
9:42
(audience laughing)
9:45
Yeah, I wanna raise children too, just like this MILF.
9:48
(audience laughing)
9:58
A friend of mine told me the other day,
10:01
my friend said to me,
10:03
"Hey, you need to grow a pair,
10:05
"grow a pair, bro."
10:09
It's when someone calls you weak
10:11
but they associate it with a lack of testicles.
10:15
Which is weird,
10:17
because testicles are like the most sensitive things
10:19
in the world.
10:20
(audience laughing)
10:23
If you suddenly just grew a pair,
10:26
you would be a lot more vulnerable.
10:28
(audience laughing)
10:30
(audience applauding)
10:35
If you want to be tough, you should lose a pair.
10:38
(audience laughing)
10:39
If you wanna be real tough, you should grow a vagina.
10:42
(audience applauding)
10:47
Those things can take a pounding.
10:49
(audience laughing)
10:51
(audience applauding)
11:04
This is fun, this is fun.
11:07
(audience applauding)
11:09
I'm doing good, y'all, I'm doing good.
11:12
Comedy's treating me well,
11:13
I had a little time off,
11:15
I gave myself a little vacation last year,
11:16
found myself in Asia, a couple different countries.
11:21
One afternoon I was eating a pork bun by a river in Kyoto.
11:25
Beautiful, I took a bite out of this succulent pork bun,
11:27
super delicious.
11:29
Out of nowhere, a wild hawk swooped down,
11:33
stole the pork bun from right out of my hand.
11:37
I was so freaked out,
11:38
I was like, oh my god, I did not know
11:40
the Mexican flag would do a remix.
11:42
(audience laughing)
11:51
I think the term munchies...
11:53
The word munchies, too damn cute to describe
11:56
the actual horror that happens.
11:58
(audience laughing)
12:01
That is too cute of a word, sounds like baby talk,
12:03
you know, like, someone's got the munchies, aw.
12:09
Highly inappropriate.
12:12
That's like saying, this dude's not a killer,
12:15
nah, he just had a case of the stabbies.
12:18
(audience laughing)
12:19
Aw, shanky, shanky, shanky.
12:29
I started using Visine.
12:33
That is a powerful drug.
12:36
I thought it was an eye moisturizer,
12:37
but Visine would change the color of your eyeball
12:39
like instantaneously.
12:42
I did a test one time,
12:43
I put Visine in one eye, just one eye,
12:49
I looked in the mirror, did a side-by-side comparison.
12:53
Control group was red per usual.
12:59
(audience laughing)
13:00
Test subject was white,
13:03
but like way too white.
13:06
(audience laughing)
13:08
Like between the two of them,
13:10
this one was more suspicious.
13:17
This one's like, maybe I have allergies.
13:23
This one's like, bitch, I ain't smoke nothing.
13:26
(audience laughing)
13:28
(audience applauding)
13:41
I live in Chinatown, 'cause that's where I got assigned.
13:44
(audience laughing)
13:46
(audience applauding)
13:56
There's a restaurant in my neighborhood
13:58
called the Sheng Wang, spelled exactly like my name.
14:04
All my friends insist that I have to go eat there.
14:07
Secretly I agree, but I don't know why.
14:11
I don't know what kind of fantasy we expect to pan out.
14:15
Like I walk in there, everyone freaks out,
14:17
they're like, "Oh my god, it's him!
14:19
(audience laughing)
14:21
"We've been waiting for you, the prophecy has begun."
14:30
I look around, there's baby pictures of my everywhere.
14:32
(audience laughing)
14:38
I realize that I have an irrational fear of rats.
14:45
I did not know there was gonna be so much wildlife
14:46
in this city.
14:47
(audience laughing)
14:48
One night, I was walking home really late.
14:51
I walked past this huge pile of garbage,
14:54
and inside one particular trash bag,
14:57
there was a whole lot of movement going on,
15:00
inside the bag.
15:02
(audience laughing)
15:03
Like, real aggressive but unidentified rustling.
15:06
I was so frightened,
15:08
my only thought was, oh my god, I hope that's a baby.
15:11
(audience laughing)
15:16
Please, just be a toddler in a bag.
15:20
That's how much I hate rats.
15:22
(audience laughing)
15:24
They make child endangerment comforting.
15:27
(audience laughing)
15:30
(audience applauding)
15:37
I saw a baseball game once, it was all right,
15:39
the most exciting part for me,
15:40
was I found a restaurant at this ball park.
15:43
The restaurant was called, Crazy Crab'z.
15:49
But they spelled crabs, C-R-A-B-'Z.
15:58
(audience laughing)
16:00
'Z.
16:02
How do you simultaneously disregard and comply with grammar?
16:06
(audience laughing)
16:09
We all know you substitute the Z for the S,
16:12
you make that word more hip, more edgy.
16:14
But for clarification, that edginess is now plural.
16:18
(audience laughing)
16:21
It's possessive.
16:23
(audience laughing)
16:25
(audience applauding)
16:31
Apparently, you don't come here
16:32
to eat a whole lot of crabs,
16:34
you come here because this one crazy ass crab
16:36
that owns this joint.
16:38
(audience laughing)
16:40
He's nuts.
16:43
He don't even serve seafood,
16:44
it's Crazy Crab'z House of Hawaiian Ribs.
16:47
(audience laughing)
16:54
Single currently, but I think it's okay,
16:55
'cause I think there's times in your life
16:57
when you gotta focus on you.
16:58
Your studies, your pursuits, what have you.
17:01
But there is a time limit.
17:05
You get a to a point where you start to question,
17:07
you're like, what's up with my soulmate?
17:11
What's up with true love, is this gonna pan out?
17:14
And then you get to another point
17:16
where you start to doubt,
17:17
you're like, what's the point?
17:19
What's the point of trying, what's the point of going out,
17:21
wasting my money, what's the point of pants and hygiene?
17:25
(audience laughing)
17:28
And I realize not only have I given up on the dream,
17:32
I gave up in my dreams.
17:36
It's disturbing.
17:37
But imagine right, I'm asleep,
17:39
I'm having a fantasy,
17:40
a room full of beautiful ladies somewhere
17:42
and I'm there looking incredibly handsome,
17:44
doing all the right things, making eye contact,
17:47
being all rude and sexy.
17:49
(audience laughing)
17:53
And right when I'm about to make my move,
17:56
right when I'm about to go in for the kill,
17:57
I'm like, man, (beep) this.
18:02
(audience laughing)
18:05
I'm just gonna fly home on my dragon
18:07
and go masturbate in my castle.
18:09
(audience laughing)
18:12
(audience applauding)
18:22
I got a buddy, my friend,
18:23
he's a 30 year old virgin.
18:26
Does not masturbate.
18:29
Seems to feel morally superior
18:31
because of his sexual restraint.
18:34
But he told me that he still gets wet dreams,
18:37
which makes me think he's just a lazy dude.
18:40
(audience laughing)
18:44
He's not pure or righteous,
18:46
he's more like a professional.
18:48
He's like, hey, dude, I can do this in my sleep.
18:54
I'm catching Zs and an O.
18:57
(audience laughing)
19:03
But most of my friends are sexually active adults.
19:09
(audience laughing)
19:10
But some of them are a little more advanced.
19:12
You know, some of them are next level
19:14
where it's harder for me to relate.
19:16
Like, you ask my friend Pedro what are you into,
19:18
what turns you on, right?
19:19
And Pedro will be like,
19:20
"Well honestly, I like a doggy style,
19:23
"but with one leg slightly more extended
19:26
"than the other one.
19:28
"So that in addition to her butt,
19:30
"there's also further contact
19:31
"between her inner thigh and my balls."
19:33
(audience laughing)
19:39
I'm like, "What the hell is doggy style?"
19:47
(audience laughing)
19:49
(audience applauding)
19:57
You know what turns me on?
19:59
Girls.
20:00
(audience laughing)
20:01
Yeah, I like girls giving a little bit of,
20:03
you know, consent.
20:05
(audience laughing)
20:07
My favorite position is mutual agreement style.
20:11
(audience laughing)
20:12
You guys have been awesome, thank you very much.
20:14
(audience applauding) (upbeat music)
20:35
(upbeat music)
