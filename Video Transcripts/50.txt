Hi. Hi. Hi.
0:04
Um, I'm, uh, Julio.
0:08
Uh, I'm an Aquarius.
0:10
My favorite color
0:14
is clear.
0:18
And I've never sent an email that didn't start with,
0:21
"Well, well, well."
0:26
( woman coughing )
0:31
Um, I'm sorry.
0:35
If you're a particularly astute viewer,
0:40
you have probably noticed that there's a very subtle
0:43
crystal formation in the corner of the stage.
0:47
- Hi. - If you blink, you miss it.
0:52
But this is my best friend, the crystal.
0:55
- Hi, Crystal. - Hi, Julio.
0:57
- How are you doing? - I'm good.
1:00
Great.
1:02
I am a vegan.
1:06
And I am so sorry.
1:13
In my experience,
1:16
the hardest part about being vegan
1:18
is all of the apologizing.
1:27
People ask me if I miss meat or dairy.
1:34
I mean, I miss being liked.
1:44
I don't miss cheese,
1:46
but I do miss getting asked to do things.
1:55
I miss my friends and I miss my family.
2:03
I went to the doctor and the doctor told me
2:06
that I was very underweight.
2:11
And I was like, "Stop it.
2:15
Shut up. You're underweight."
2:23
He wasn't.
2:27
He was just, like, an average-sized doctor.
2:31
But I figured he was being so nice
2:33
that I should just throw him a little something.
2:40
I'm sorry if I seem a little bit...
2:45
distracted.
2:46
I just got my lab results back,
2:51
and just as every doctor suspected,
2:54
I'm simply too much.
3:04
I was at a party for a work thing,
3:08
and this guy asked me,
3:11
"Hey, Julio, will you be able to stick around
3:14
or do you have to run away to some rave?"
3:18
And at first, I was very, very offended
3:22
until I remembered the last time
3:24
I saw him I said,
3:26
"Hey, sorry I can't stick around.
3:27
I got to run away to some rave."
3:31
So that one's on me.
3:34
Another fun fact about me is that I am almost always
3:39
doing exactly what a Trump supporter imagines that I'm doing.
3:44
( cheers and applause )
3:54
And let me tell you, it's a lot of fun.
