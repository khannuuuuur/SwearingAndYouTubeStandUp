WOMAN: Talent's on the move.
0:12
MAN 3: Hey, have your tickets out.
0:13
MAN 4: Stage is ready.
0:15
EMCEE: What's going on, Boston?
0:17
(audience cheering)
0:19
Tonight is the night!
0:21
Welcome to Comedy Central's The Half Hour.
0:24
(audience cheering)
0:26
Put your hands together for Beth Stelling!
0:30
(audience cheering)
0:37
What's up, Boston?
0:40
(cheering) Hey.
0:41
Thank you.
0:43
I am happy to be here.
0:45
Stand-up comedy is very, uh,
0:48
female-dominated.
0:50
(audience laughs)
0:51
I was doing a comedy festival in Austin
0:54
and sometimes, when you check into your hotel,
0:57
uh, the festival's left, like, a little gift bag for you.
1:00
Which is nice.
1:01
And so I was checking into the hotel
1:03
and there were a bunch of male comics in front of me,
1:04
checking in, and, like, good for them.
1:06
You know, for trying. You know?
1:09
And I got up and the lady said to me,
1:11
"Do you want your bag?"
1:13
And I said, "Yeah."
1:14
I mean, of course I want what's free, you know?
1:18
I realized she hadn't asked any of the dudes
1:20
if they wanted it, and I didn't realize why
1:23
until I got back to my hotel room
1:24
and saw that the main gift from the festival
1:26
for all the comics was a Fleshlight.
1:30
(scattered laughter)
1:33
Yeah, so there's, like, 32 perverts here.
1:36
Uh...
1:38
Either that, or you're just, like, on a first date
1:40
and you don't want her to know that you're a psycho.
1:42
Um...
1:44
If you don't know what a Fleshlight is,
1:47
uh, it's a sex toy.
1:48
Okay?
1:49
Uh, this one...
1:51
I mean, it could be a butt, a fake butt.
1:54
This one was a fake pussy.
1:56
A synthetic vagina, if you will,
2:00
um, disguised within a flashlight.
2:06
I don't know why.
2:09
I guess so if you're jacking off
2:11
and your mom walks in on you,
2:12
you're like, "Ah! It was a blackout!
2:17
I got scared, I (bleep) the flashlight!"
2:23
Arguably worse, you know,
2:25
uh, than if she had just caught you
2:27
with your penis in your hand.
2:28
Uh, 'cause now she's worried, you know?
2:30
Maybe calling all the neighbors.
2:32
"I don't know, apparently Tom's (bleep) all the appliances!"
2:37
So all the dude comics
2:39
were having a great festival, you know?
2:40
(bleep) themselves.
2:43
Um... what was I to do,
2:46
as a lady comedian,
2:47
with a Fleshlight, you know?
2:49
Except for just practice kissing all weekend.
2:51
Huh?
2:54
I got really good at it.
2:57
Um...
2:58
It started kissing back.
2:59
And then...
3:02
I walked it over to the FedEx,
3:04
popped it in the mail, sent it to my boyfriend at the time,
3:06
'cause I'm an American hero. So...
3:08
Uh, he lived in Ohio,
3:10
uh, which is where I grew up.
3:13
A lot of people in Ohio don't realize
3:16
that you can just put all of your things into a bag
3:19
and then leave.
3:26
Scoot right on out. (laughs)
3:28
You know?
3:30
My mom and I, uh,
3:34
we go way back.
3:36
And...
3:39
she's so sweet, but she's, like,
3:40
very uncomfortable with anything sexual.
3:42
Okay? I think it's 'cause she's a virgin.
3:44
Uh...
3:47
But she knows that I like the word "boner."
3:49
It's a silly word; fun activity.
3:52
And on Halloween last year,
3:55
she sent me a little card in the mail.
3:56
You know, like all moms do on Halloween.
4:00
(chuckles)
4:02
It said, "Happy Halloween."
4:04
Like, a little skeleton on the front of it.
4:06
(chuckles)
4:07
This is the skeleton.
4:10
This is also what I look like
4:12
when I'm trying to look thin in a fat out.
4:16
And then, underneath, it said, "Bone Appétit."
4:19
Okay?
4:20
And then you open it up
4:22
and my mom had hand-written in there,
4:23
"Or boner appétit to you."
4:37
No.
4:39
I think you just told your daughter
4:40
she's got an appetite for boner.
4:42
And I do, you know?
4:45
But I never finish 'em.
4:47
(scoffs) So...
4:52
I just get mine and then I scoot.
4:58
My mom, uh, has been with Sprint
5:01
for the last... 70 years.
5:03
And, uh, and she had a little Jitterbug flip phone thing,
5:07
uh, and it stopped working, so she took it into the store
5:11
and she was like, "My phone's broken."
5:12
And they were like, "You dropped it."
5:14
And she's like, "I never." You know?
5:17
And my mom didn't drop it, okay?
5:19
She keeps it, like, in her quilt purse,
5:21
wrapped in a quilt, in another quilt.
5:25
The phone rings and my mom's like,
5:27
"See you later."
5:37
"Hello?"
5:39
And then no one's there.
5:42
So she goes, "Well, how much is it to replace?"
5:45
And they said, "$200."
5:47
And she's like, "I paid $29," you know.
5:50
And they're like, "Yeah, well, with the rebate and everything."
5:51
She goes, "I need to go home and think about it."
5:53
Which only a 63-year-old woman can do, you know?
5:58
They just, like, spend three days without a phone
6:00
just to figure out whether it's cost-viable.
6:02
You know?
6:03
So she goes home and calls me
6:04
from the landline looking for some advice,
6:07
and I was just like, "Yeah, Mom.
6:08
Figure out how much longer you have left."
6:10
You know?
6:13
On the plan, you monsters.
6:17
So you don't have to pay to get out of it, you know?
6:20
She goes, "Okay."
6:21
So she calls them from the landline
6:23
and they say, "Yeah, we can answer that for you.
6:25
"We just need you to answer some security questions
6:28
and get into your account."
6:31
And my mom goes, "Okay."
6:33
And Sprint said, "Who was your childhood best friend?"
6:37
And my mom said, "Margo."
6:40
And Sprint said, "No."
6:47
And she goes...
6:50
"Was it Gail?"
6:54
And they're like, "No."
6:55
And she goes, "Oh, my God. I don't know. Was it Trudy?
6:57
And they're like, "Ma'am,
6:58
"you can really only answer this so many times.
7:00
Why don't you think about it and give us a call back?"
7:03
(laughter, applause)
7:14
So then my mom calls me again.
7:15
She's like, "This is bogus." (laughs)
7:18
And I was like, "It is.
7:20
And I got her all fired up and I was like,
7:22
"Screw Sprint, Mom. Screw Sprint!"
7:24
And she was like, "Don't cuss."
7:28
And then she called them back and she's like,
7:29
"I'm gonna be leaving your company.
7:31
I am going over to my daughter's company, AT&T."
7:35
Like I own it, you know?
7:38
And they're like, "We're sorry to hear that.
7:40
(bleating) We're Sprint."
7:45
And then my mom goes,
7:47
"Well, can I know who my childhood best friend is?"
7:54
(applause) (laughs)
7:57
I just got out of a three-year long distance relationship.
8:02
Thanks for being here for me.
8:05
(laughter)
8:07
Just a light chuckle.
8:08
Um...
8:09
he lived in Ohio and I live in California.
8:13
And, uh, we would see each other when we dated
8:15
about once a month, you know?
8:17
So we'd have sex, like, once a month
8:19
a ton of times, you know?
8:21
It was like a reverse period.
8:23
And...
8:26
I feel like nobody can really get upset by the word "period."
8:29
I think every single person in this room
8:30
has prayed for a period, at some point in their lives.
8:32
Yeah.
8:35
But I did love him so much that I went out
8:37
and I got his name, uh, tattooed on my back.
8:40
(chuckles) Whoopsy daisy.
8:42
And, you know, my best friend was like,
8:45
"Wow, Beth, worst mistake of your life.
8:47
What if you sleep with somebody else?"
8:49
Like, point taken, you know.
8:50
If I am sleeping with somebody else
8:53
from behind and see this tattoo,
8:56
I can just look back at them and be like,
8:57
"Hey, this is the kind of commitment
8:59
you can expect from me."
9:02
(applause)
9:05
(chuckles) Thank you.
9:07
That'll do it, you know?
9:09
It's not, like, bubble letters and hearts and things like that.
9:12
It's actually just his signature.
9:13
So it's really more of, like, a lease...
9:15
is how that... worked out.
9:18
When we broke up,
9:20
I was single, uh, for about a day.
9:25
You know? Uh... (chuckles)
9:27
And that is when I realized
9:29
I'm a little bit of a Tarzan dater, you know?
9:32
Like, before I let go of this dick,
9:34
I'm just, like, swinging to the next dick.
9:39
So, there's really only a brief period of time
9:40
where you can catch me. (chuckles)
9:43
Without a dick in my hand.
9:46
And...
9:47
one of my first jobs was at a bagel shop.
9:51
Uh, so as you can imagine, a lot of times,
9:52
I was just, like, serving bagels,
9:55
uh, straight to my face.
9:57
'Cause I gained a lot of weight.
9:59
And I took the job why we all take jobs in food service--
10:03
uh, for the sexual harassment.
10:04
And...
10:06
that worked out great.
10:07
I think it was around Christmastime,
10:10
uh, that my boss-- my boyfriend--
10:13
my boss, uh,
10:15
he announced we were having a weight loss challenge.
10:18
Which sounds illegal.
10:20
Um... so I quit.
10:22
And... eventually, I did get very tired
10:26
of people, like, just getting
10:27
a boner for my personality, you know?
10:32
So I wanted to lose some weight, get in shape.
10:34
And I started to ride my bike everywhere.
10:36
Which is great-- it keeps your haunches tight.
10:37
Like, I'm probably gonna bike until I die, you know?
10:41
So I can have, like, an open leg casket.
10:43
(laughter)
10:45
Don't steal that idea, dude.
10:47
You could do it, too.
10:50
But I rode my bike in, like,
10:53
every city that I lived in.
10:57
And when I lived in Chicago, I would bike through the winters.
10:59
And it gets freezing, so I'd have to just, like,
10:59
bundle up real tight.
11:02
And one day I was bundled,
11:03
and I pulled up to a stop sign.
11:05
Some old man must've been waiting for the bus,
11:06
'cause he leaned over to me and he goes,
11:08
"Excuse me, sir?
11:10
Is the bus coming?"
11:13
And I was like, (groans)
11:14
"I'm a girl."
11:17
And then I rode away, you know?
11:20
So the rest of that winter,
11:21
I was just wearing my bra on the outside of my coat.
11:25
(laughter)
11:27
And making sure that my dick
11:29
was tucked up in my pants.
11:32
That's just a safety thing-- you know what I mean.
11:35
It could get caught in my chain, so...
11:39
Gives you an idea of how big it is.
11:41
(laughter)
11:44
When it's warmer out, I can wear less clothing.
11:46
Like, my sex is more apparent, you know?
11:49
And I was biking to a show in Los Angeles,
11:51
trying not to crash as I was, like,
11:52
checking out my own cleavage, you know?
11:54
And a man in a van pulled up next to me,
11:57
and he leaned out his window,
11:58
and he just goes,
11:59
♪ Sex... ♪
12:07
And I said...
12:08
♪ No... ♪
12:13
Mm-mm.
12:15
Really more of a song that we created together.
12:17
It's hard to ride away from somebody
12:18
when you collaborate like that.
12:22
I had to.
12:25
I usually, uh, will date potheads.
12:28
It's kind of my thing, you know?
12:29
I don't know why.
12:31
I guess they can't leave if they're already gone.
12:33
That's...
12:36
Yeah, that's what it is, you know?
12:38
And I've done it since college.
12:39
And I remember this one time in college,
12:42
trying to impress this pothead,
12:44
which you know... isn't hard.
12:48
And everybody was smoking weed.
12:51
Uh, so I went ahead and just, like,
12:52
smoked all of it. (chuckles)
12:54
Until I thought that my mouth
12:56
would never be wet again.
12:59
And then I proceeded to eat an entire pint of ice cream.
13:02
Just to be able to swallow, really.
13:05
Just to, like, wet my whistle.
13:09
'Cause I was fairly certain
13:10
that the police were coming, you know?
13:12
And somebody was gonna need to talk to 'em.
13:15
So...
13:19
And then everybody started to get up and leave,
13:22
like, one by one, 'cause of me.
13:24
'Cause I was making it awful for everybody.
13:27
(wry chuckle)
13:29
And the guy that I liked started to get up and go.
13:31
And I was like, "Oh, no," you know?
13:33
So I looked at him and I was like,
13:35
"Hey, it was really good to see you.
13:37
You, too."
13:39
I answer for him.
13:41
(laughter, scattered applause)
13:43
Yeah. (chuckles)
13:44
(applause)
13:46
Yeah.
13:48
Just threw in a little,
13:49
"You, too!"
13:50
And then I laughed for about three days.
13:56
My parents are divorced. Did I say that?
13:58
Or is that obvious? Um...
14:00
And when I was home for Christmas,
14:02
my mom tried to give me her old wedding ring--
14:05
uh, the one that my dad gave her,
14:08
and I was just like, "This is haunted."
14:12
(chuckles)
14:13
"What am I gonna do with this haunted, haunted ring?"
14:16
You know?
14:17
I mean, I don't know if I'm gonna get married.
14:18
Who's to know?
14:21
I mean, my husband could be here tonight, so that's just...
14:25
(scattered whooping, laughter)
14:29
He's into it.
14:32
If I do get married,
14:34
like, the only thing I know, like, for sure,
14:36
is that I'll be using my own hair as my wedding veil.
14:39
You know?
14:40
So I'll just, like, kind of come down the aisle just like...
14:48
Real slow.
14:53
No bouquet, probably just a mic, you know?
14:57
And I'll get down there, and my dad will just be like,
15:00
(whispering): "What the (bleep)?"
15:06
"This is my fault."
15:08
You know?
15:09
And it is. (chuckles)
15:11
Uh...
15:13
And then he's gonna have to figure out
15:14
how he's gonna get it off my face tastefully.
15:16
In front of everybody, you know?
15:19
I'll just be ready for the crowd.
15:20
You know, just like...
15:21
(moans)
15:26
(chuckles)
15:27
So hopefully, you'll be left at the altar, you know?
15:30
And then we can be together.
15:32
(chuckles)
15:36
My parents divorced when I was, like, three years old,
15:39
and then my two older sisters and I started going
15:40
to visit my dad where he had moved,
15:43
in Orlando, Florida, when I was, like, six,
15:44
'cause it was court-ordered.
15:47
And... I love my dad so much.
15:50
He just, like, does not have a way with words.
15:52
You know, like...
15:54
I remember getting off the plane in high school to go see him,
15:56
and the first thing he said to me was, like,
15:57
"Hey, B, looks like you got a little bit of acne."
15:59
I was like... (chuckles) "Okay."
16:03
And then after my first year of college,
16:06
he was like, "More like the freshman 40, eh?"
16:09
(chuckles)
16:10
I was like, "Well, Dad, I eat because you left us, so..."
16:17
(chuckles, sighs)
16:22
My dad used to take us to this water park in Orlando.
16:27
It's called Wet 'n Wild.
16:28
(scattered whooping)
16:30
Oh, my God.
16:32
So many people have lived.
16:34
Wet 'n Wild has, like,
16:36
one of the tallest water slides in the United States.
16:38
It's called the "Der Stuka," okay?
16:40
So one day, my whole family down there, except for my stepmom,
16:43
'cause she's too drunk to take in public,
16:45
uh, but we decided we were gonna take this slide on
16:48
together as a family, really do it up, you know?
16:52
So my uncle goes down first,
16:54
uh, and he gets quite a bit of water up his shorts, okay?
16:59
Like, went down with shorts, stood up with a thong, you know?
17:03
So my sister's turn is second,
17:05
and she's in the height of her puberty,
17:06
so she's wearing, like, a string bikini, orange,
17:08
and when she goes down this vertical drop
17:10
of, uh, whatever-story slide,
17:12
her bikini top flies up, and her chest is just, like,
17:14
exposed to hundreds of water park onlookers,
17:19
which, I'm gonna let you know right now, ruined her life.
17:26
I'm sitting at the top of the slide,
17:28
uh, in my own piss, and...
17:34
...my oldest sister behind me is yelling, like, "Go!"
17:36
I'm nine, okay?
17:38
I'm, like, just tall enough to ride this thing.
17:40
The lifeguard over here,
17:42
we'll call him "the lifeguard,"
17:47
shoves me down.
17:49
I have, like, no time to cross my hands and my legs over my bod
17:53
as the signs specifically instructed
17:58
as I was climbing hundreds of feet into this death trap.
18:02
Water shot so fast and violently at my crotch.
18:07
(chuckles)
18:08
I consider that day at Wet 'n Wild
18:09
the day I lost my virginity.
18:13
(chuckles)
18:14
I was nine, you know?
18:16
I could have gone with waiting a year.
18:21
With somebody that I loved, you know?
18:26
I've recently worked up the courage
18:27
to compose a little letter to Wet 'n Wild.
18:31
"Dear Wet 'n Wild, why haven't you called?"
18:36
"May I suggest you change the name of the slide
18:39
from 'Der Stuka' to 'Just-Douched-Ya.'"
18:42
Eh?
18:47
Last thing I'll say. Um...
18:49
I used to be more judgmental of the show The Bachelor,
18:53
and then I fell in love
18:55
with, like, the tallest, ugliest haunted tree.
18:59
Just to feel small, you know?
19:02
And that was in Chicago, it wasn't even in Maui.
19:05
Uh, so I have a little more empathy for these women.
19:07
And I love waiting until it gets down to, like, the final two...
19:12
you know...
19:13
crazy bag women that are just vying for one man's love
19:16
on national television.
19:18
So I can hear one of them say something like
19:20
"Never in a million years...
19:25
"would I have ever imagined...
19:29
falling in love this hard..."
19:31
(laughter)
19:34
"...or this fast... on national tele..."
19:44
(applause)
