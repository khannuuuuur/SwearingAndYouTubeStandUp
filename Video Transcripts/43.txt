I was invited to a frat party late last year.
0:03
I went 'cause I'd never been. I was excited.
0:05
It was during rush week.
0:07
I wanted to see some rush, some hazing.
0:09
I saw some, and it was lame. I was disappointed.
0:12
All they did was make the pledges drink, that's it.
0:14
They would randomly be, like, "Pledges, drink up!"
0:16
And all these guys were drinking.
0:17
I was, like, "That's it?
0:19
"That's all you're gonna do?
0:20
"You don't want to see what they're willing to go through
0:23
to be frat brothers?"
0:25
God, that made me wish I was a frat boy so bad.
0:29
Just to be that eccentric one who only comes out
0:31
of his room during rush week.
0:33
Only comes out to (bleep) with their heads.
0:36
You know, like, "All right, pledges, line up! Line up!
0:40
"Y'all want to be Sigma Nigma Nu?!
0:43
"Y'all want to be Sigma Nigma Nu?!
0:45
"Let's see if you got what it takes!
0:47
"You, here's a case of warm beer. You know the drill.
0:50
"Drink-drink-drink-drink!
0:52
"You, dip your scrotum in this fishbowl
0:55
"full of angry scorpions.
0:59
"You... count to 40 out loud.
1:04
"You... go out back-- there's a kiddy pool
1:06
"full of heroin-addict piss. Bathe in it.
1:10
"You... e-mail your favorite cousin.
1:14
"Just say hi.
1:17
"You... force your grandmother
1:20
"to watch this (bleep) film with you
1:23
"on Easter Sunday whilst you eat Cadbury eggs together.
1:27
(audience groans)
1:30
"You... take a nap right now.
1:33
"Power nap, bitch, no pillow.
1:38
"You... siphon-start that sumo wrestler's enema.
1:44
(audience groans)
1:49
"You... just hang out. You're cool.
1:52
"Sigma Nigma Nu Nu! Sigma Nigma Nu Nu!
1:55
"Sigma Nigma Nu Nu!
1:56
"Sigma Nigma Nu-Nu-Nu!
1:58
(hysterical voice): "Nu Nu, Nu-Nu-Nu!
2:00
"A Sigma Nigma Nu Nu! Nu-Nu-Nu-Nu.
2:02
"A Sigma Nigma Nu Nu! A Nu Nu! A Nu Nu!
2:04
"A Sigma Nigma Nu Nu baby! (giggles)
2:07
"A Sigma Nigma Nu Nu baby!
2:09
"A boy? A Sigma Nigma Nu Ni boy?
2:12
"A Sigma Nu Ni boy?
2:14
(normal voice): "A man! A Sigma Nigma Nu Nu man!
2:17
"A Sigma Nigma Nu Nuni responsibility,
2:19
"integrity, leadership.
2:26
"That's the handshake, pledge!
2:28
"Learn it!
2:31
"Only one of you made it, obviously.
2:33
"The guy who drank. He's in.
2:34
The rest of you are weird."
2:39
Oh, let's get it on, people.
2:42
To you, you know?
2:44
(cheering, applause)
2:51
Hey, on the rare occasion I am in the gym,
2:53
you ever see the guy who's, like...?
2:56
"Ah!
2:59
Ah! Ah!"
3:02
It's, like, "What are you, a dragon?
3:04
(bleep) wrong with you?"
3:05
That's vodka, by the way.
3:09
Can you imagine if this were vodka
3:10
and I just chugged that much of it?
3:13
This set would end
3:15
in a completely different manner than I...
3:17
I would suddenly be, like,
3:19
(slurring): "Okay, okay, you want a funny joke?
3:22
"Okay, I got a funny joke for you.
3:25
"Love isn't real. (laughs)
3:32
(sobs softly)
3:34
"You know what she said to me?
3:36
"You know what she said to me? You know what she said?
3:38
"She said, 'I can't be with anyone right now.'
3:42
"Oh, I didn't know I was just anyone.
3:44
"I thought we were soul mates.
3:48
"It's my fault. It's my fault.
3:51
"I opened, I opened myself up to her.
3:54
"I said, 'That's me. That's how I work.
3:59
"'That's my heart. You want to touch it?
4:02
"Want to touch my heart?'
4:04
"She goes, 'Uh-huh.'
4:05
"Took it. Took it away from me.
4:08
"Kept it. Used it as a paperweight.
4:10
"Used it as a doorstop.
4:13
"Used it to knead pizza dough.
4:16
"Met another guy, right?
4:19
"And he was, like, 'You want to have sex?'
4:21
"And she was, like, 'Of course I do. I'm a whore.'
4:25
"And he, and he goes, 'Well, I don't have a condom.'
4:27
"And she goes, 'Well, here, just use Sean's heart as a condom.
4:32
"It works great around the house.'
4:34
(voice breaks): "And he did! That's what he did!
4:37
"He put my heart on his (bleep) like a prophylactic,
4:41
"and he had sex with her!
4:44
"And he (bleep)... He (bleep) my heart.
4:46
"Did my heart bust on him like a dirty old condom?
4:49
"No, it did not.
4:50
"'Cause it's a strong heart. It's reliable.
4:55
"It got, it got pregnant.
4:58
"It got pregnant and it wanted to keep the baby.
5:02
"'Cause it's a loving heart full of nurtureness.
5:06
"But she was, like, 'No!'
5:07
"And she punched my heart in its stomach
5:10
"till it had a miscarriage.
5:12
"So now my heart's psychologically damaged
5:14
"wandering around truck stops
5:15
giving aorta jobs for five dollars a pop."
5:19
(sobbing)
5:24
Fortunately this is just water.
5:28
Unfortunately all of that was true.
