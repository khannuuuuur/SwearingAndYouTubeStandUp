IKE BIRBIGLIA.
0:08
[CHEERS, WHISTLES & APPLAUSE]
0:14
HERE WE GO.
0:29
HOW ARE YA? NICE TO SEE YA.
0:31
I-- NICE TO SEE YA. WOW.
0:34
THIS IS REALLY NICE. I-- INTRODUCE MYSELF PROPERLY.
0:37
- I'M MIKE BIRBIGLIA. - WOO!
0:40
YEAH, I'M-- THANKS. I'M ITALIAN.
0:43
MY FAMILY'S NOT REAL ITALIAN. WE'RE LIKE OLIVE GARDEN ITALIAN.
0:46
AND SOMETIMES PEOPLE COME UP TO ME AND THEY'LL BE LIKE,
0:49
YOU KNOW IN ITALY IT'S PRONOUNCED BIRBILLIA.
0:52
I'M LIKE, "IN AMERICA, YOU'RE ANNOYING."
0:55
[LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE]
1:00
IT WAS A HARD NAME TO HAVE GROWING UP.
1:02
KIDS WOULD CALL ME NAMES LIKE BIRBIGGLEBUG AND BIRBIGLIOGRAPHY
1:06
- AND [BLEEP]. - [LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE]
1:11
SOME WERE MORE CLEVER THAN OTHERS. BUT--
1:16
I WAS AN ALTAR BOY WHEN I WAS A KID.
1:19
- AND THE ANSWER IS NO. - [LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE]
1:24
I WAS VERY AMBITIOUS AS A CHILD, THOUGH.
1:27
I HAD BIG GOALS. I WANTED TO BE A COMEDIAN OR A RAPPER OR THE OWNER
1:32
OF A PIZZA RESTAURANT WHERE THIRD GRADERS COULD HANG OUT.
1:35
THOSE WERE MY GOALS. I WANTED TO BE A RAPPER.
1:39
I REALLY DID. AND IT SURPRISES PEOPLE 'CAUSE I'M A WHITE BREAD CRACKER.
1:45
THAT'S MY FAVORITE WHITE PERSON SLUR, "WHITE BREAD."
1:48
THE OTHER DAY SOMEONE WAS LIKE, "WHAT'S UP, WHITE BREAD?"
1:52
AND I WAS LIKE, "THAT'S NOT EVEN AN INSULT. THAT'S JUST MY RACE
1:57
PLUS A FOOD." I WAS LIKE "I CAN DO THAT TOO, BLACK BEAN SOUP.
2:04
[LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE]
2:07
YOU STAY OUT OF THIS, ASIAN CHICKEN PLATTER."
2:10
[LAUGHTER CONTINUES]
2:14
I LIKE IT USING THE WORD CRACKER A LITTLE BIT IN MY ACT,
2:17
'CAUSE A LOT OF BLACK COMICS USE THE "N" WORD.
2:19
I LIKE USING THE "C" WORD LIKE "ME AND MY CRACKER FRIENDS
2:22
WERE DRIVING DOWN THE STREET IN MY VOLVO STATION WAGON.
2:25
AND I SAID, "HEY CRACKER, PASS THE SUN CHIPS."
2:29
AND HE SAYS, "NOT 'TIL WE GET TO THE PICNIC, CRACKER." AND I SAY, "CRACKER, PLEASE."
2:38
[CHEERS, WHISTLES & APPLAUSE]
2:45
HE'S LIKE, "CRACKER WHAT?"
2:50
BUT WHAT HAPPENED IS I SAID THAT IN A SHOW.
2:53
AND THIS BLACK GUY COMES UP TO ME AFTER THE SHOW
2:54
AND HE WAS LIKE, "GREAT SHOW, CRACKER." AND I-- IT WAS NICE.
2:59
AND I WAS LIKE, "ACTUALLY, YOU CAN'T CALL ME A CRACKER.
3:05
"ONLY WE CAN CALL EACH OTHER CRACKERS.
3:10
YOU CAN SAY CRACKAH, BUT NOT 'CRACKER.'"
3:15
AND HE WAS LIKE "IT'S OKAY, I'VE GOT WHITE FRIENDS
3:17
AND THEY'RE COOL WITH IT." SO I COOLED DOWN.
3:21
I COOLED DOWN. I WAS PRETTY ANGRY.
3:25
I JUST LIKE DOIN' THAT VOICE.
3:28
THE LIKE, "ME AND MY CRACKER FRIENDS HAVE A--"
3:31
IT'S LIKE MY WHITE GUY DOING A BLACK GUY DOING
3:32
A WHITE GUY VOICE. 'CAUSE A LOT OF BLACK COMICS
3:35
HAVE THE ONE WHITE GUY VOICE, LIKE, "THIS IS RIDICULOUS."
3:39
LIKE WE ALL TALK LIKE BRITISH DETECTIVES.
3:42
AND I DON'T KNOW ANYONE WHO TALKS LIKE THAT.
3:45
I FEEL BAD FOR THE ONE GUY ON EARTH WHO DOES TALK LIKE THAT,
3:49
WHO'S WATCHING THOSE COMICS ON TV AND HE'S LIKE, "THIS IS PREPOSTEROUS.
3:53
"THAT DOESN'T SOUND LIKE ME AT ALL.
3:55
"WAIT 'TIL I GET MY HANDS ON THAT BLACK FELLOW.
3:58
- BUT FIRST I'M GONNA DANCE." - [LAUGHTER, CHEERS & APPLAUSE]
4:08
OH, YEAH. I-- THAT'S HOW WE DANCE.
4:11
I HEARD THAT. I HEARD THAT.
4:13
I WANTED TO BE A RAPPER WHEN I WAS A KID.
4:15
BUT RAP WAS VERY INNOCENT WHEN I WAS A KID.
4:17
IT WAS JUST LIKE, "RIMMINA RAP RAP RAP, RAPTASTIC." YOU KNOW?
4:21
[LAUGHTER]
4:25
IT'S GOTTEN SO ARBITRARILY AGGRESSIVE. RAPPERS NOW WOULD BE LIKE,
4:28
"IT'S 2005 MOTHER-[BLEEP]."
4:32
I'M LIKE, "YOU'RE MAD ABOUT THE DATE?
4:34
[LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE]
4:39
"YOU GOTTA PICK YOUR BATTLES. I MEAN YOU GET MAD ABOUT THAT,
4:43
NO ONE'S GONNA BELIEVE YOU WHEN YOU'RE MAD ABOUT REAL STUFF."
4:47
LIKE, "YOU CRASH INTO MY CAR MOTHER-[BLEEP]."
4:51
"YEAH, BUT YOU'RE MAD THAT IT WAS 2005.
4:55
YOU'RE LIKE THE BOY WHO CRIED MOTHER-[BLEEP]."
4:58
[LAUGHTER, CHEERS & APPLAUSE]
5:02
THIS WAS JUST A-- ALL RIGHT. ALL RIGHT.
5:05
I'VE BEEN TAKING PHOTOS OF EVERYTHING ON THE ROAD LATELY.
5:16
- AND I FIND THAT PHOTOS... - [LAUGHTER]
5:21
ARE A VERY INACCURATE DEPICTION OF EVENTS, THOUGH,
5:24
'CAUSE YOU'RE NEVER LIKE, "HEY, REMEMBER THAT TIME
5:26
- WE WERE LIKE." - [LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE]
5:34
AND I FEEL LIKE THERE'S TOO MANY CAMERAS RIGHT NOW.
5:36
LIKE YOU GO TO BUY SOMETHING AND EVERYTHING'S ALSO A CAMERA.
5:39
THEY'LL BE LIKE "IT'S ALSO A CAMERA."
5:42
I'M LIKE, "I JUST WANTED A GRAPEFRUIT."
5:44
THEY'RE LIKE, "IT'S A CAMERA GRAPEFRUIT.
5:47
"YOU TAKE PICTURES OF YOURSELF EATING THE GRAPEFRUIT
5:49
AND THEN YOU EAT THE CAMERA AND YOU POOP THE PICTURES."
5:53
"OH, MY GOD. THAT'S THE OPPOSITE OF WHAT I WANTED."
5:57
[LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE]
6:01
TECHNOLOGY'S MOVING SO FAST. IT'S TO THE POINT
6:03
YOU CAN MAKE STUFF UP AND PEOPLE WILL BELIEVE YOU.
6:05
YOU CAN BE LIKE, "YOU SEEN THE NEW SONY TELEPORTER?"
6:09
PEOPLE WOULD BE LIKE, "NO, BUT I HEARD ABOUT IT."
6:12
I END UP SAYING THAT ALL THE TIME.
6:15
"NO, BUT I HEARD ABOUT IT."
6:19
IT MEANS I HAVEN'T HEARD ABOUT IT, BUT I LIKE YOU.
6:22
- [LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE] - HOLD ON. HOLD ON.
6:28
I'M GONNA DO ONE MORE THING BEFORE WE GO TO COMMERCIAL.
6:33
HOLD ON. STAY THERE.
6:36
OKAY.
6:39
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
6:46
THANKS.
6:48
THAT'S ARTHUR, EVERYBODY. GIVE HIM A ROUND OF APPLAUSE.
6:52
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
6:55
SO I LIVE HERE IN NEW YORK CITY. AND...
6:58
[CHEERS, WHISTLES & APPLAUSE]
7:00
OH, THANKS.
7:05
I'VE GOT AN APARTMENT AND IT'S A LITTLE BIGGER
7:07
- THAN MY BODY. AND... - [LAUGHTER]
7:13
AND MY FRIEND CAME OVER TO GIVE ME ADVICE.
7:15
HE WAS LIKE "YOU GOTTA GET A NICE LITTLE HAND SOAP
7:17
FOR YOUR BATHROOM BECAUSE WOMEN LOVE THAT."
7:20
AND I WAS LIKE, "DO THEY ALSO LOVE IT WHEN YOU'RE SHOWER'S
7:23
ONE FOOT FROM YOUR TOASTER, 'CAUSE I GOT THAT GOIN' ON, TOO?"
7:29
[LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE]
7:33
I SAW A MOUSE IN MY APARTMENT THE OTHER DAY.
7:36
AND I HAVE A REALLY SMALL PLACE. I WAS LIKE,
7:38
- "WHERE ARE YOU GONNA SLEEP?" - [LAUGHTER]
7:43
BUT I GOT A GREAT BUILDING. WE GOT OUR OWN DRUG DEALER.
7:46
SO EVERY TIME I WALK OUT MY DOOR
7:48
THE SAME GUY TRIES TO SELL ME DRUGS.
7:51
LIKE I'M WALKING OUT IN THE MORNING TO GET A SNAPPLE
7:53
AND HE'LL BE LIKE, "YOU WANT WEED?"
7:55
AND I'M LIKE "DO YOU HAVE ANY SNAPPLE?"
7:57
'CAUSE I THINK HE SHOULD ALSO SELL SNAPPLE.
8:00
THAT WAY HE HOOKS YOU IN WITH THE SNAPPLE.
8:02
AND THEN HE'S LIKE "YOU KNOW WHAT WOULD GO GREAT WITH THAT SNAPPLE? CRACK."
8:07
IT WOULD BE LIKE AMAZON.COM. "IF YOU LIKE SNAPPLE,
8:10
- "YOU MIGHT ALSO ENJOY... - [LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE]
8:18
BALLOONS OF HEROIN."
8:20
AND I'D GO, "WELL, I NEVER THOUGHT OF IT THAT WAY."
8:23
I DON'T SMOKE A LOT OF POT ANYMORE.
8:26
I'M THE LEAST FUN PERSON TO SMOKE POT WITH.
8:29
NO ONE WANTS TO HANG WITH THE GUY WHO ENDS EVERY SENTENCE WITH,
8:32
"DO YOU GUYS HATE ME?"
8:35
I'M NOT GOOD AT DRINKING EITHER. I JUST BECOME ANOTHER PERSON.
8:41
LIKE LAST YEAR WHEN I'M DRINKING AND I MET THIS GIRL,
8:44
SHE GAVE ME HER NUMBER. BUT THE NEXT DAY I DIDN'T EVEN WANNA CALL HER.
8:47
I DIDN'T FEEL LIKE SHE MET ME.
8:48
I FELT LIKE SHE MET TWO-DRINK MIKE.
8:51
LIKE, YOU KNOW, TOTALLY DIFFERENT.
8:55
TWO-DRINK MIKE LOVES DANCING AND KNOWS A MAGIC TRICK.
8:58
ZERO-DRINK MIKE ENJOYS BIOGRAPHIES
9:03
AND HAS SERIOUS OPINIONS ABOUT WILDLIFE.
9:06
AND FIVE-DRINK MIKE ENJOYS DANCING WITH WILDLIFE
9:12
AND THAT'S...WHICH IS HOT. WHICH IS HOT.
9:15
[LAUGHTER, WHISTLES & APPLAUSE]
9:19
BUT I WISH I WERE BETTER AT DRINKING, BECAUSE I LOVE SEX.
9:26
WHICH IS WEIRD 'CAUSE I USUALLY ONLY LOVE THINGS I'M GOOD AT
9:31
LIKE BADMINTON AND DRINKING HOT CHOCOLATE.
9:36
BUT SEX IS TRICKY. IT'S KIND OF LIKE A SPORT.
9:43
BUT IT'S NOT LIKE A TEAM SPORT OBVIOUSLY-- SOMETIMES.
9:48
BUT IT'S KIND OF LIKE TENNIS WHERE YOU NEED TO FIND SOMEONE OF YOUR OWN ABILITY.
9:54
'CAUSE IF THEY'RE BETTER THAN YOU, IT'S AWKWARD,
9:58
IT'S LIKE SHE'S WAILING THE BALL AT YOU AND YOU'RE LIKE,
9:59
"I'M NOT GETTING ANYTHING OVER HERE.
10:02
[LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE]
10:07
"DO YOU LIKE AN UNDERHAND SERVE OR A LOB?
10:10
YOU'VE TAKEN A LOT OF LESSONS."
10:13
[LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE]
10:19
ARE YOU-- AREN'T YOU WORRIED ABOUT TENNIS ELBOW?
10:24
I LOVE SEX. I LOVE PIZZA.
10:28
- [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] - I DO. I LOVE PIZZA.
10:31
SEX AND PIZZA THEY SAY ARE SIMILAR.
10:34
WHEN IT'S GOOD IT'S GOOD. WHEN IT'S BAD,
10:37
YOU GET IT ON YOUR SHIRT OR WHATEVER.
10:41
I THINK THAT'S HOW IT GOES. I'M NOT SURE.
10:44
DON'T QUOTE ME ON IT. IT'S LIKE SOMETHING LIKE THAT.
10:48
I'M NOT VERY POLITICAL AS A COMEDIAN.
10:50
I FEEL LIKE WHETHER YOU LIKE HIM OR NOT,
10:52
I THINK BUSH SEEMS LIKE A FUN GUY,
10:54
LIKE HE'S THAT GUY YOU INVITE TO THE BARBECUE
10:56
'CAUSE YOU KNOW HE'LL START THE WIFFLE BALL GAME.
10:59
HE'S LIKE WIFFLE-BALL TONY. YOU'RE LIKE, "YEAH,
11:04
"WIFFLE-BALL TONY'S HERE. ALL RIGHT. ALL RIGHT.
11:07
THIS IS COOL." AND THEN ONE DAY SOMEBODY'S LIKE,
11:09
"WE'RE GONNA PUT TONY IN CHARGE OF EVERYTHING."
11:12
[LAUGHTER, CHEERS & APPLAUSE]
11:22
AND I'M LIKE, "WE ARE?
11:26
"I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S SUCH A GOOD IDEA BECAUSE HE'S VERY COMPETITIVE.
11:31
"HE STARTS GOING INTO THE NEIGHBOR'S LAWN.
11:33
CHALLENGING THEM TO WIFFLE BALL GAMES."
11:35
HE'S LIKE, "I HEAR YOU WANNA PLAY WIFFLE BALL, BITCHES?"
11:38
AND THEY'RE LIKE "WE NEVER SAID THAT."
11:40
BUT HE STARTS CHUCKIN' HAMBURGERS AT 'EM,
11:43
WE'RE LIKE, "TONY, WHAT ARE YOU DOIN', MAN?"
11:45
HE'S LIKE, "THEY WERE GONNA CHUCK HAMBURGERS AT ME!"
11:48
BUT THEN IT TURNS OUT THEY DON'T EVEN HAVE HAMBURGER
11:51
- IS THE THING. - [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
11:57
I MEAN THEY HAVE HOT DOGS
12:02
BUT THEY ONLY THROW 'EM AT EACH OTHER, SO IT'S COOL OR WHATEVER.
12:08
BUT THEN PEOPLE GET UPSET. YOU KNOW THEY'RE LIKE,
12:13
"WELL, MAYBE WE SHOULD HAVE GONE WITH BOOKWORM STEVE.
12:17
BUT HE'S SO BORING." THEN ONE GUY'S LIKE, "WHAT ABOUT ME?
12:19
WHAT ABOUT RALPH? HOW ABOUT RALPH?"
12:22
AND WE'RE LIKE, "SHUT UP, RALPH, THIS IS NO TIME FOR JOKES."
12:25
IT'S WEIRD, BECAUSE YOU GO TO DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE COUNTRY
12:37
AND PEOPLE GET VERY PERSONALLY OFFENDED
12:38
BY TALKING ABOUT BUSH AT ALL. LIKE I WAS IN WASHINGTON, D.C.
12:41
AND THIS WOMAN CAME UP TO ME-- THIS IS A TRUE STORY--
12:43
SHE GOES, "YOU KNOW HE COULD BE HERE."
12:47
[LAUGHTER]
12:52
AND I SAID, "FIRST OF ALL, NO. HE'S PROBABLY ON VACATION."
13:00
[LAUGHTER, CHEERS & APPLAUSE]
13:07
I JUST STARTED PLAYING GUITAR THIS YEAR.
13:10
AND-- I JUST-- YOU KNOW I HAD A LOT OF--
13:13
- [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] - THANKS--
13:15
YOU KNOW A LOT OF TIME TO KILL IN HOTELS.
13:17
I'M JUST A BEGINNER, SO I'M NOT VERY GOOD.
13:20
BUT I LOVE MUSIC. LIKE SOMETIMES WHEN I'M DRIVING,
13:22
I'LL LISTEN TO THE RADIO FOR HOURS.
13:25
AND I'LL LISTEN TO CHRISTIAN ROCK BY MISTAKE,
13:28
BECAUSE IT ALWAYS STARTS OUT AS LIKE A BON JOVI BALLAD.
13:33
- YOU KNOW? - [LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE]
13:36

14:05
I THOUGHT THIS WAS THE OATMEAL SONG."
14:07
I LOVE PLAYING GUITAR.
14:11
BUT I THINK THERE'S LIKE A DANGER
14:13
IN PLAYING GUITAR TOO MUCH.

17:33
IT WAS AN ABRAHAM LINCOLN SUITS.
17:37
AND THEY HAVE THESE ABRAHAM LINCOLN QUOTES EVERYWHERE.
17:39
AND ONE OF 'EM WAS LIKE,
17:41
"WHATEVER YOU ARE, BE A GOOD ONE."
17:44
AND I JUST DON'T FEEL LIKE HE SHOULD GET CREDIT FOR GENERALITIES LIKE THAT.
17:50
LIKE JUST LIKE, "'HOW ARE YA?' ABRAHAM LINCOLN."
17:53
"'GOOD TO SEE YA.' ABRAHAM LINCOLN."
17:57
"'WELL, WE ALREADY BOUGHT THE TICKETS.' ABRAHAM LINCOLN."
18:01
[LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE]
18:05
