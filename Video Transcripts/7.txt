look I'm probably not gonna live long enough to teach you everything you need to know so let's just run through a couple things real fast number one I
0:06
need you to treat women with respect always even if you think you're right be respectful number two don't mix white
0:12
and dark liquor that's how you end up in the back of a police car speaking of which get you a white friend black man

0:35
I'm gonna put this on video for you and when you're old enough you come back and watch it deal all right deal
0:43
thank you Frederick Douglas [Applause]
1:27
but if we get rid of the Confederate flag
1:33
how am I going to know who the dangerous white people are
1:39
I'm just saying the flag had a couple upsides let's just be real about it ain't saying keep it around but I grew
1:45
up in the South I can't tell you how many times the Confederate flag came in handy to stop him for gas at a strange place
1:51
at two in the morning you see that flag hanging from the window you know this is not the place to get gas
1:59
and just keep it moving
2:06
what's the rush to get rid of the flag especially if you white if you're white you should want to keep the flag for a
2:11
little while longer so at least black folks to know you cool because if you're writing you're not an
2:17
that's the one thing that helps us identify you you get rid of that flag
2:23
to figure out a way to know who the cool white people cool white people we just got to start giving y'all wristbands or
2:28
handstands just something you can show in a dark alley
2:34
let us know you down with the struggle that'd be cool Give Me Your Money white dude like whoa
2:43
I'm so sorry come on
2:53
hand on folks talking about they wear the Confederate flag they ain't racist
2:59
that's fine just know that it's a dark alley I ain't got time to ask you no questions
3:04
I see that flag it just is what it is you wear a particular garment you just got to accept the fact that you were
3:11
going to be assumed to be part of a particular organization that's just what it is I love the color blue I love wearing
3:18
blue but the Crips have informed me that maybe I should wear blue all the
3:25
time because the games don't mess around they still don't want you wearing any colors
3:30
you can't wear the blue which make me mad damn brother I'm 38 years old at what point can I wear blue again sir
3:38
you know I obeyed all the game rules in my 20s I didn't wear your colors but I'm grown at this point if I want to put on
3:44
a blue shirt I should be able to put on the blue shirt if I want a blue shirt but they don't do that the Crips get in
3:50
your face yeah what Hood you claiming boy what hood you know sir I'm claiming adulthood okay
3:56
that's my hood
4:04
now the Blazer on this everybody's so bad I had a Blazer on on top of my blue shirt what makes you think of it what
4:10
game you know put a Blazer on before they start murdering who you know
4:16
even if I am a obviously I'm a supervisor you're out of line
4:23
I will write your ass up Atlanta what's going on how y'all doing
4:28
man y'all good oh yeah thank you a lot man
4:35
love the South man I'm from Birmingham man that's good
4:43
yeah yeah Birmingham in here I love the South man you know South we got some
4:48
tension we got our issues you know I talked to my uncle about it you know my uncle first thing we need to do is get
4:55
rid of the n-word my uncle don't like the n-word my uncle Derek hate the n-word we trying to my uncle trying to quit the n-word the way people try to
5:02
quit cigarettes a little bit at a time it's a word ain't no Cravings either you
5:07
say it or you don't [Applause] I'm not gonna be calling me every week
5:13
with updates I only said it four times [Applause] four times now Sunday's my cheat day
5:20
because I watch football I got to sing it I got to say it on Sunday grown man dropper first down I got to call him the
5:27
n-word that's just what it is and that's my thing with the n-word like like at this point black folks like if
5:34
we trying to get stuff done politically in this country we we we inching we're doing we inching we inching but at this
5:39
point I think it's time for us to schedule a meeting with gay people because gay people get way more done than us
5:47
they don't mess around gay people shut down
5:54
they want something to go away it's gone they don't fool around man every week is five six new words you can't call gay
6:00
people black folks we've been working on the n-word since 1804.
6:09
you can't get one word out the American vocabulary date people up to 37 words
6:14
we need to go to Panera and have a meeting with gay people and have a soup and salad and figure
6:21
this out [Applause] that's how you figure out your issues
6:26
over soup and salad you can't even say gay no more that's
6:32
how good gay people are the only word left to address gay people by you better not fumble that word in
6:38
the sentence that's your ass you use gay in the wrong context at work and see if you don't have to go talk to
6:44
Sylvia and HR HR be on your ass immediately because
6:51
you Mumble gay one time the wrong way you was by yourself when you said you still got in trouble
6:58
it's not like he was walking through the cubicles telling gay jokes he was in the break room he was alone
7:04
and your chips got stuck and you cussed that don't mean you're a bad person you
7:09
was just hungry and you say anything when you're hungry every man in this room we've all been
7:14
through it them chips get stuck at the top of the machine and you try to jostle the machine a little bit the chips don't
7:20
fall and nobody got changed for a dollar so you can buy two packs give me the chips you gay ass machine
7:28
seal the aligned to Sylvia line two security to the break room security to
7:35
the breaker that's it you gone because you caught some chips gay
7:41
but that's the power of the gay agenda they figured out a way to influence the political process of this country to
7:47
make sure that their issues are at least heard even if people don't get the bills passed they at least listen to them and
7:53
that's what I'm trying to tell my uncle you don't like the n-word man you want to get rid of the n-word this is all you
7:58
got to do start calling gay people
8:07
it'll be gone tomorrow
8:14
listen I don't like it either all right but that's the best idea I got right now okay
8:19
at least that's what I'm gonna teach my son I'm a father figure I got to show him the right way
8:26
they try to divide us on television you know but there's a lot of people that aren't
8:33
black that's standing on the right side of issues that affect us I appreciate
8:38
those folks you know we don't get highlighted enough
8:46
plenty of people out there that care about black stuff I haven't seen them man I went to I went to a black history
8:52
museum I had a white tour guide hey it threw me off for a second
9:00
I turned to the brother that was on the tour with me is this the dude he gonna do
9:07
it was a white dude it was a white dude telling me about my
9:12
and he was good I was trying to hate on him by the end of the tour I was like yo bro you did
9:19
your thing man straight up fam you do what you do hey real quick let me give you one of these wristbands real quick
9:25
yeah put that on face to go down you want to wear that wristband
9:33
you got to respect a white person work at a Black History Museum you gotta respect that that was a choice
9:42
he white he could work anywhere he chose a black history museum you know that job
9:48
interview was a son of a how many extra questions did he have to
9:55
answer because you black and old it ain't to work the Civil Rights Museum you just walk in uh that's me on the picture
10:07
you filling out paperwork for you on the wall but if you white you know they just
10:13
grilling that dude asking them all kinds of questions they had nothing to do with black history all in that dude face
10:19
paperwork looks good everything checks out real quick uh at what temperature do you deep fry
10:26
catfish [Applause]
10:36
350 that's what okay that's more [Applause]
10:47
I know some folks got a problem with that you don't want a white person at Black History Museum I understand that
10:52
here's the thing I'm not saying they better than a black tour guide I think a black tour guide or the Civil Rights Museum I think they're better equipped
10:58
to speak on the experience because they might have lived that life they can speak to certain exhibits from a perspective that nobody else can I just
11:05
think if you go to a black history museum you got a black tour guide you need to go in the morning while he's
11:11
still in a good mood [Applause]
11:16
that brother is stressed you can't walk around slavery all day for eight hours
11:24
and not cuss at somebody somebody getting close
11:31
you got to catch him at 9am he just finished that McGriddle how y'all doing
11:36
my name is Charles it's my pleasure to take you on this journey look at these exhibits right here
11:42
black history of American History come look at the exhibits you think that brother gonna be in a
11:47
good mood at 4 30 he been staring at slavery [Applause] I do liable to cuss out everybody
11:54
look at this come look what you've done to us look what you've done to us
12:00
look what you get your ass out my museum
12:07
you go to the gift shop it's just people crying that's horrible okay
12:19
my thing is this man it don't matter we may not agree on the problems we might not agree on the solutions but we got to
12:24
agree that something's wrong something's wrong in America
12:34
something is definitely wrong it's black people standing on the freeway that is not normal black behavior that
12:42
is a byproduct of a desperate situation where you're trying to bring attention to an issue that is these protests
12:49
happen fast man and Justice happens fast so the demand for justice has to be even quicker and I
12:54
get it and that's the thing with being black now these protests happen anytime they catch you off guard
13:00
you got to be ready I was at Red Lobster in New York [Applause] you know I'm just chilling I'm eating a
13:06
cheddar baked biscuit good day I come out the door it's a wave of black
13:11
people coming down the street and this is the thing with being black man like if you see a bunch of black
13:16
people protesting you are now also protested
13:22
that's in it I don't know what you have planned today but you walking you just got to merge in
13:29
as soon as I came out of Red Lobster this dude was in my face it's you with us brother yeah I went in to get y'all
13:35
some cheddar face [Music] this is one of them biscuits man
13:40
we got a long way to walk you got to have your simple starch
13:50
protests happen fast one protests happen fast you know when that
13:55
stuff first started happening you know somebody got fired somebody lost their job because of that because that's such
14:00
a radical way to express displeasure with a with a broken system
14:06
you know to literally just walk down the on-ramp of a freeway that's not normal
14:13
like that's so crazy like I guarantee you when all this freeway stuff started to happen I guarantee you some people
14:19
lost their job because their boss didn't believe ain't no way your boss believed you when you said it was a wall of black folks on the freeway
14:28
it's outrageous I guarantee you somebody lost a job somebody had to go in and explain to
14:35
their boss you know a wall of negroes Turner what's your excuse that's time
14:41
sir you're not gonna believe this here [Applause] it was a wall of negroes up on the
14:47
freeway that's not how black people protest Turner get the hell out of that
14:53
that's not the worst part the worst part is that that dude got fired then he had to go to the new job and put down reason
15:00
for leaving the old job there ain't enough room in that application ain't enough room to write in and a wave of black people you can't
15:06
write that in so I'm looking at your paperwork kids is uh that you were
15:12
you had an issue with being on time at your last job you care to share with me why you were late at your last job
15:22
[Applause] ain't gonna believe this here
15:27
it was a wave of negroes on the freeway okay and how did how did that how did
15:33
that style of protest make you feel well I tell you how it made me feel it was a little inconvenient but at the
15:38
end of the day as a society we should focus more on what people protest instead of how people protest
15:44
I couldn't agree with you more didn't agree with you more
15:49
tell you what you're hired Welcome to the Black History Museum
15:59
you're on the team
16:06
something's wrong man just don't be one of these people that's surprised that black folks got issues
16:12
then the people I can't deal with I'd rather talk to somebody that don't agree with me than somebody has had their eyes closed
16:19
how did you know black people why are black people angry we've been angry
16:25
this ain't new you think this just happened last couple of years black folks been trying to tell
16:31
y'all forever that they've had some issues and we sat we invented the Blues
16:40
but more of a sign that you need we literally invented an entire genre of
16:48
music based on sadness that's how sad we we the blues was created here that is an
16:54
American art form that is not native Africa do you go listen to Old African music this has happened cause we
17:00
was free all right every old Africans are here to freedom
17:07
in Africa
17:12
as soon as we got off the slave ship
17:20
[Applause] we've been sad
17:27
how the hell are you surprised you're not patriotic the black people
17:35
don't like the national anthem anymore
17:41
ain't no shock to you man you want to know what black folks feel and just listen to their music our music tell you
17:47
everything that's going on in the black psyche it's a beautiful Telegram
17:53
and nowhere in the history of black music is there a hit patriotic song
18:02
I mean what we do I mean we'll cover a song but like we don't write no original patriotic song
18:07
black artists ain't never because we got a conflicted relationship with the country you can't write no honest patriotic song you got to lead that the
18:14
white artist they ain't had a good time he had a good time in America you're
18:20
damn right you should be writing the Patriotic and I'm proud to be in America
18:30
maybe serious You couldn't possibly expect that level
18:37
of patriotism from a race of people that have so many issues you can't it's not
18:42
realistic black people don't we don't sing about America we sing about specific cities where you can have a
18:48
good ass time that's what we do
18:55
we're going to talk about the country we can tell you where the party at though we can do that look I can't tell you nothing about
19:01
America but let me tell you about the city where the heat is on all night on the beach to the early Mall
19:07
welcome to Miami that's what you got to go if you have been to California oh my God
19:12
boy you got to go down to California boy boy California knows how to party
19:17
the city of L.A the city of good old watch and the city of Compton they keep it rocking write that down I'm
19:23
trying to tell you you keep it rocking
19:30
black people don't do patriotism maybe George on my mind that's the
19:35
closest we probably come maybe that maybe that that's a good song it's warm it's about the country Ray Charles George on my mind good song Black
19:43
the key word next song is on my mind
19:49
Ray Charles was just thinking about Georgia he didn't tell you to go there
19:56
[Applause] George is like every other part of the South it's got some Pockets you should
20:02
not be in after dark if you'd have asked Ray Charles to be more specific on where in Georgia to go Peter said go to
20:09
Atlanta where the players play and they ride on them things like every day
20:25
my uncle Derek trying to shut me down on them yeah what about James Brown Living in America
20:31
that's patriotic Jane Brown singing about America is original and he black
20:37
Living in America
20:42
[Music] it's a good song but keep it real man James Brown wrote that song for Rocky IV
20:48
and as soon as he finished singing it Apollo Creed died in the ring it's a sad song
20:56
it's a sad song how can you hear Living in America and I
21:01
think about Apollo Creed just Fallen lifeless to them Michael B Jordan lost his daddy that day
21:11
[Applause]
21:17
if anything Living in America is not patriotic it's the opposite it's a
21:22
secret message to black people James Brown is one of the most masterful musicians to ever walk this Earth to
21:29
it's a brilliant song that song ain't got nothing to do with America that entire song Living in
21:35
America is a secret message to black folks all y'all do listen to the end of the song very end of Living in America
21:40
all James Brown do is just start naming cities that's it enter the song Living in
21:47
America
21:53
naming safe places for black folks yes
22:03
he wrote a song about America and then at the end told black people specifically where to go rent an
22:08
apartment he was just Living in America but only here on the Detroit and Pittsburgh
22:15
New York City Kansas City don't go nowhere else
22:21

anytime a black person following the Civil Rights movie they fall then they do that double bounce in the dirt and the dirt come up
23:42
get out of here [Music]

25:45
the thing about this country is this we're all Americans people love to say

25:56
you're American American what the hell I would just be out on my hurricanes
26:03
yeah we are we all Americans but we live in two different Americas
26:10
that's what it is people forget that people forget how stressful it is to be
26:15
black man being black yo it's a job
26:22
you gotta clock in every day okay nobody cover your shift for black
26:29
it's exhausting some days it's literally exhausting to be that's why there's no black ghost because we tired
26:39
okay black folks are so tired we don't even have the strength to come back from the
26:44
dead we just we'd rather nap
26:53
I don't think everybody that doesn't understand what we go through is
26:58
necessarily racist or bigoted that's a far jump it's a lot of folks that just straight up don't know what it's like
27:05
you got to educate them you got to educate them on the kind of America you live in I
27:11
go to Best Buy and give the dude some straightening
27:16
straighten his ass out yeah I'm straightening
27:21
dude at Best Buy gonna decide I don't need a bag with my purchase
27:30
you just have an iPhone case I figure you could just pop that open I don't know ain't popping you'd put it in
27:36
the bag I need that in the back
27:42
what do you need a bag for I understand what you need a bag it's wasteful recycle don't you care about the Earth
27:50
oh so this has nothing to do with the Earth I'm a black man in America
27:56
I gotta leave this store with a bag bruh
28:02
it's about safety I'm black I don't get the luxury of just
28:08
walking out with in my hand that is a roll of the dice that is a horrifying
28:14
day if I don't know not only do I need that bag I need that receipt
28:20
and staple it to the outside
28:25
I don't want to receive my hand you stable my receipt to the outside like Chinese carryout
28:31
and I hold it up in the air I lying here Hakuna Matata an iPhone case
28:36
out of Best Buy and it's not his fault he just didn't
28:42
understand he thought he was saving the Earth but he was saving a life that's what he was doing
28:47
this has nothing to do with the recycling man because see you might be a cool person he might the cashier might
28:52
be a cool ass dude but we don't know what the security guard has been through up front
28:58
how come prancing out to Best Buy with this naked ass iPhone case in my hand
29:03
and here comes security excuse me sir did you pay for that oh yeah I got the receipt he going for a gun
29:30
we all Americans just different Americas
29:36
black folks we also gotta we gotta try are you saying we're going to do it but we got to try sometimes to get the
29:43
benefit of the doubt sometimes everything ain't racist
29:48
about two percent it's about two percent that ain't racist
29:54
you got to recognize that two percent I was in McDonald's this dude was
29:59
cussing everybody out swole up as racism I walk in this fast food spot this dude
30:06
cussing everybody this is the thing
30:12
I deserve to be cussed out they do they deserve a good every now and then because the thing
30:17
they do now some of these fast food spots they love to charge you for sauce when you get nuggets
30:23
you know you want an extra sauce with your nuggets it's gonna be you want another sauce brother it's gonna be 25
30:28
cents how are you charging for sauce bro that's I want two sauces well I need a
30:35
quarter it ain't your sauce just slide that across the counter
30:44
sitting here arguing with a grown man about two ounces of sauce that don't even belong to you it'd be
30:50
different if this was a mom-and-pop restaurant and Special Sauce and she's making it in the basement but this is
30:55
sauce from a factory it's in a box it's not like your register gonna come up short two honey mustards man just
31:04
give me the sauce you ever beat the guardian of the sauce
31:10
this dude is serious and got a different color shirt from everybody else at work so now he
31:15
arrogant well you know brother I'm supervisor now I should know
31:21
if it was up to me I would give you another sauce it is up to you
31:27
it's on your side of the counter
31:36
I just want two sauces without paying for them that's all I want
31:41
but I walked in this spot man this dude was cussing out the whole store was racism
31:48
and I'm not saying that racism wasn't one of the causes for him getting bad service I'm just saying he jumped to
31:53
that conclusion a little fast he didn't go through the progressions
31:59
he ordered a six-piece nugget it was five nuggets in the Box
32:07
and I didn't even know even know what's going on I'm texting as soon as I walk in the door I'm texting I hear this dude I hit this dude over in the cut I hear
32:13
this dude go I kill everybody in this
32:18
[Applause]
32:25
you know that that gave me pause he said he'll kill everybody in this
32:31

46:12
you get married you get your woman that can cook and get married I don't know about marriage like
46:20
a lot of my friends are married and I get I'm at this weird age now I'm at this weird age where like I got friends
46:25
getting married late and I got friends that's getting divorced you know and I don't know who to go
46:31
celebrate with
46:37
I'll tell you this much you get a wedding invitation from somebody in their 30s that is dope
46:43
is to the point love it can stand getting wedding invites from
46:50
our buddies and then moving in our 20s first of all wedding invitations is way too long
46:56
I don't need eight paragraphs to know what's going on just tell me what about a gift is it
47:02
going to be free liquor that's all I need to know you were cordially invited on the fifth
47:08
day of Our Lord in the 10th month of the savior to witness Two Souls
47:17
love is a flame that burns a Turner Walmart free liquor I'm like all right
47:25
[Applause]
47:33
you get a wedding invite from one of your homeboys in their late 30s she's to the point
47:38
my homeboy texted me his wedding yeah you know what it is
47:46
smiley face send I was like all right that's what's up
47:52
bro that's what's up this is my thing about divorce what I love about divorce I love how people
47:58
won't shut the hell up about their wedding but they divorce is none of your business
48:04
that's not cool you running your mouth all this time about your engagement y'all break up
48:10
what happened I want to know tell me what happened especially if I went to the wedding if I
48:15
went to your wedding and you divorced I'm entitled to a one-page explanation
48:21
much money as I spent you tell me why y'all getting divorced or you give me back to toaster I bought
48:26
your ass it's a good ass toaster that's full slice with the crumb tray that's top shelf
48:32
What A Bagel button do you all know about that Bagel button that's footballers the issue for me is that I had great
48:39
examples of marriage growing up with my parents and their friends but horrible examples through my friends I only got
48:46
like a handful of friends that are happily married so when you're surrounded by miserable people you assume that that choice will make you
48:52
miserable as well which isn't fair but that's just the psyche of it right because I see my friends and some of my
48:58
homeboys are married and ain't miserable all they want to do is like stay out late they ain't even trying to cheat they just want to not go home
49:06
and they try to marry me and they slick married men try to pull you into the lot oh yeah I told Keisha I told this dude
49:12
no you should not have said that because now we both gonna get murdered I don't want to die
49:18
married man y'all don't even give us enough time to learn a lot that's what's so low down you want me to lie to your wife dude I
49:25
need three four days rehearsal we need to walk through this but that's not what married men do they
49:30
call you five minutes before the hit the fan hey uh she about to hit you up just say shrimp scampi click
49:41
what does that even mean that's that's not even a complete sentence
49:47
you say scampi she'll know it
49:56
marriage is forever man forever is a long time that's a long time and women ain't
50:01
playing around with their marriage y'all committed once a woman is in it she's in it
50:07
for life we in it you don't believe me go watch this TV
50:13
you want to see how committed women are go watch this TV show called The Walking Dead
50:19

51:48

52:13
looking out into the water and then it flashes back to everything that happened on the ship he drowns she lives they
52:19
come back present day and she's looking out into the water and then people are coming up and talking to him ma'am are
52:25
you are you thinking about all your friends you lost out there oh no baby I'm thinking about that good dick that

53:16
once they had sex one time in Titanic she remembered it for the next 70 years
53:27

54:09
I like old people man I hope I hope I'm blessed enough to to live long change to
54:14
diet up and a couple years on the back end you know old people I just I want to get to that
54:21
age where I can just cuss people out for no reason you know I'm saying just unprovoked
54:27
cussed out yeah she already smiling you almost there you gotta look because you look a little young you
54:34
got a little more time but you just you already trained you already cussed people now
54:40
man you oh you get to just cuss people out for no reason I was in the grocery store this old dude
54:46
rolled up on me man I was in the struggle
54:57
and you weren't there I wasn't bothering this dude
55:03
[Applause] I'm in produce I'm picking out my Fuji apples I'm not bothering nobody Fuji apples
55:09
he rolled up his sleeve he showed me the scars dude's old 80 85 years old
55:14
look at that Scott asked me asked me how I got the sky
55:20
how'd you get this guy I got it in the struggle
55:25
you don't know what it was like in 62 I'm like what was it like it was a
55:31
struggle yes and this is the thing man this is the thing with old black people man old black people like you can't disrespect
55:37
them because they have physical proof that they were willing to die to make the country a better place for me so I
55:42
have to salute it I paid for its groceries this dude called me for 20 minutes
55:49
and I paid for his groceries just off respect they got me thinking on the way home
55:58
you know what have I done and that's that's a that's a very sobering feeling it's a sobering
56:05
realization to have to realize that what you've done doesn't quite measure up to
56:10
what that man did you know this dude called me and got free groceries
56:18
that's how much he put in work like I know I'm not gonna get that same result like I wish I could but I know
56:24
I'm not I'm like little kids gonna rob me like when I'm 80 I'm getting robbed
56:29
all right no that's what they're gonna do they're gonna take the tennis balls off my Walker and I'm gonna be stuck
56:35
take the battery out in the hover around and just push me out in the truck because the thing is that you start
56:42
reflecting you start reflecting on what you've done that compares to that and I look at the
56:49
things that I try to do now like I try my best to be socially active I try my best to do stuff on a daily show that
56:55
affects change I try
57:01
but I'll be real a lot of what I do now is
57:06
just making up for lost time because I wasn't always like that and that's something I'm ashamed about
57:13
I didn't go see Obama get inaugurated because it was too cold [Music]
57:19
that was my excuse that was my excuse for missing history is cold
57:24
and my homeboys call me up we riding the bus we going up to D.C the ride I got cable man
57:32
I didn't go the second time I had four years to buy a coat
57:38
[Applause] still didn't go see him I skipped history twice that's embarrassing
57:45
because sooner sooner or later my son's gonna be doing the book report on that
57:51
and he's gonna flip to that Obama inauguration page and you're gonna see those thousands of black people out in
57:57
the National Mall just standing there and he's going to come to me and I got to be accountable for my absence
58:04
daddy were you there
58:09
yeah yeah
58:15
yeah I'm right they cropped me out I was right there on the side
58:26
I just hope that you know what I try to do now is enough you know that's all you can do
58:33
is what you can do but I want free groceries
58:38
I'm not sure if what I did is enough so I might have to just spice up my story just add whatever happened
58:46
because when I'm 80 I'm gonna go in the grocery store cussing out kids
58:52
you wouldn't in the struggle
58:58
ER of 1017. what was it like it was a struggle in 2017 and we tried to March
