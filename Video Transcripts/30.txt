(audience clapping and cheering loudly)
0:22
(applause drowns out speech)
0:27
- Nice.
0:28
(audience laughing loudly)
0:30
You come to work, you get that type of response.
0:33
That's good, that's good.
0:34
I needed it, I had a rough day.
0:37
(audience laughing softly)
0:40
(Sebastian sighs heavily)
0:41
Went to the grocery store.
0:44
Always a problem at the grocery store.
0:48
Is it hard to pay?
0:50
(audience laughing softly)
0:53
Always something going on in my line, right.
0:56
(audience laughing softly)
0:58
Always in the back, I'm like, "What are they doing?"
1:01
(audience laughing softly)
1:04
Who's still paying in check?
1:07
(audience laughing loudly)
1:12
You'll see it.
1:13
It will come out of a bag in slow motion.
1:18
Then the whole line sees it.
1:20
(audience laughing loudly)
1:26
'Cause it's just not the checkbook,
1:28
things go with the checkbook, right.
1:31
Glasses always come on.
1:33
(audience laughing loudly)
1:40
Gotta find the check, hold on.
1:45
Always asking questions.
1:46
Who do I write the check to?
1:48
(audience laughing softly)
1:50
John's Market, it's on the guy's apron, it's on the bags.
1:55
There's a lot of hints here.
1:57
(audience laughing softly)
1:59
I got no patience for people.
2:01
Guy had four items in front of me.
2:03
I'm like, four items.
2:04
How are we gonna screw this up?
2:05
(audience laughing softly)
2:07
They scan it.
2:08
Boop, boop, boop, boop.
2:09
Then he pulled this one and a pack of cigarettes, please.
2:13
(audience laughing softly)
2:14
Now we gotta go to the cage.
2:15
(audience laughing softly)
2:20
That's what we're doing.
2:22
We're doing errands, right, that's all we do.
2:24
Went to Ross for Less.
2:25
Anybody been to this nightmare?
2:27
(audience laughing softly)
2:28
I walked into Ross,
2:29
I thought I walked into Downtown Beirut.
2:33
(audience laughing softly)
2:36
I thought a bomb went off at this store.
2:39
Everything's on the floor.
2:42
(audience laughing softly)
2:46
How are they shopping over there?
2:49
Were they pulling stuff off the shelf?
2:51
This is not my size.
2:53
(audience laughing loudly)
2:56
(audience clapping loudly)
3:05
I went looking for jeans.
3:07
I heard they had cheap jeans over there, right.
3:10
So I'm in a store shopping.
3:12
(audience laughing loudly)
3:22
I found a pair in housewares.
3:25
(audience laughing softly)
3:27
Stamped irregular.
3:29
Anybody looking at irregular clothes?
3:31
You're not getting a deal.
3:34
You see irregular, you gotta lay 'em out.
3:37
You gotta find out what the hell happened.
3:40
(audience laughing softly)
3:43
Why are these a dollar?
3:45
(audience laughing softly)
3:50
'Cause originally $175.
3:53
(audience laughing softly)
3:55
Now slashed to a dollar.
3:57
(audience laughing softly)
3:59
And if you're like me, you're looking at the pants,
4:01
you're like, I can't find the mistake here.
4:04
I think they made the mistake.
4:06
I think I found the treasure.
4:07
(audience laughing softly)
4:11
'Til you get to the fitting room.
4:13
(audience laughing softly)
4:14
I went to go try 'em on.
4:16
I went to go get the zipper, the button, all this stuff,
4:18
wasn't even here.
4:20
(audience laughing loudly)
4:22
(audience clapping loudly)
4:27
I found that right here on the calf.
4:30
(audience laughing softly)
4:32
(audience clapping softly)
4:37
All the underwear, it's all boxed.
4:42
The box has been ripped open so many times
4:49
they got a duct tape 'em shut.
4:51
(audience laughing softly)
4:53
You don't even know what you're buying.
4:55
(audience laughing softly)
4:56
I took a gamble on some CK boxer briefs for 39 cents.
5:02
(audience laughing loudly)
5:05
I brought 'em home, I cut the box open, it's a set of forks.
5:08
(audience laughing loudly) (audience clapping loudly)
5:45
I just got a problem.
5:48
Impatient, people, airports, enough.
5:52
What is going on at the airport?
5:56
Could we put a dress code at the airport?
6:00
(audience laughing softly)
6:01
It looks like a slumber party over there.
6:03
(audience laughing softly)
6:06
Do people care what they look like anymore?
6:08
(audience laughing softly)
6:10
They just come out now as is, like.
6:13
(audience laughing softly)
6:14
They must roll out of bed.
6:16
(audience laughing softly)
6:19
And then they're at United.
6:21
(audience laughing softly)
6:23
(audience clapping loudly)
6:24
What the?
6:26
(audience clapping and cheering loudly)
6:28
I'm not.
6:29
(audience clapping and cheering loudly)
6:36
I'm not into this.
6:38
I'm not into casual.
6:39
I like the '50s, '60s, people dressed up, right.
6:43
I'm not into this whole casual.
6:45
You meet these people, I'm comfortable.
6:48
(audience laughing softly)
6:50
I don't care what people think of me,
6:52
long as I'm comfortable.
6:55
Yeah, I'm uncomfortable that you're comfortable.
6:58
(audience laughing softly)
7:00
(audience clapping loudly)
7:03
Shower.
7:05
(audience laughing softly)
7:08
I'm not into this, it's gotta stop.
7:11
When you go to the airport.
7:12
When you see the world, the world sees you.
7:16
(audience laughing softly) (audience clapping softly)
7:21
And now what we do, we sit down in the plane
7:26
and now we look to see what catastrophe
7:29
(audience laughing softly)
7:31
that's gonna be sitting next to us for five hours.
7:33
(audience laughing softly)
7:35
Right?
7:37
(audience clapping loudly)
7:39
I know.
7:40
(audience clapping loudly)
7:44
And it's never this, it's never this, beautiful ladies.
7:47
I could tell, my guy.
7:50
(audience laughing softly)
7:51
I could sense it, right.
7:53
(audience laughing softly)
7:54
Like he gets on the plane.
7:55
We make eye contact like, oh, this is him.
7:57
(audience laughing loudly)
8:05
Everybody's got everything.
8:06
Everybody's got their Starbucks.
8:10
(audience laughing softly)
8:13
I had to stop at the Starbucks before I got on.
8:16
I got behind the couple
8:19
that can't keep their hands off each other.
8:20
You ever get behind this couple?
8:21
It's disgusting.
8:23
(audience laughing softly)
8:24
She's holding onto him from behind.
8:27
(audience laughing loudly)
8:31
Like, he's gonna take off.
8:33
(audience laughing softly)
8:35
It's Starbucks, he ain't going anywhere.
8:37
(audience laughing softly)
8:41
She was dating some softy.
8:43
Guy had flip flaps on.
8:44
What's this, flip flops.
8:49
You seen some of these guys' feet?
8:51
(audience laughing softly)
8:53
Men's feet are disgusting.
8:56
(audience laughing softly) (audience clapping softly)
8:59
He had the finger foot.
9:00
What is this, you ever seen this?
9:02
(audience laughing loudly) (audience clapping loudly)
9:05
Toes so long, he's got knuckles on 'em.
9:08
(audience laughing softly)
9:11
Like he could pick up an orange
9:12
and then throw it at you.
9:13
(audience laughing loudly)
9:16
You have a hand on your foot.
9:18
(audience laughing softly)
9:22
Take care of your feet.
9:25
Just because you're in the shower and they're getting wet,
9:27
doesn't mean they're getting, right.
9:30
This concrete with this ash look here on the heel.
9:35
You want take a pumice stone to that?
9:37
(audience laughing softly)
9:39
File.
9:41
You got a cinder block on your foot.
9:42
(audience laughing softly)
9:45
Sock it.
9:46
(audience laughing softly)
9:49
(audience clapping loudly)
9:52
Yeah.
9:53
(audience clapping loudly)
10:00
When he turned to his lady, he's like,
10:02
"Honey, (sighs) do you wanna share a lemon loaf?"
10:08
(audience laughing softly)
10:13
(audience clapping softly)
10:14
What the hell did you just say?
10:16
(audience laughing softly)
10:19
Did lemon loaf just come outta your mouth?
10:21
(audience laughing softly)
10:24
How do you feel like a man and order a lemon loaf?
10:26
(audience laughing softly)
10:27
I would never get that, even if I wanted one.
10:32
I'd point to it, get one of these.
10:33
(audience laughing loudly)
10:36
Right there, right there.
10:38
That.
10:39
(audience clapping loudly)
10:41
This one.
10:42
(audience clapping loudly)
11:17
Another woman had a dog at the airport dressed up.
11:20
What's this?
11:21
(audience laughing softly)
11:23
What's with the dogs?
11:26
I got a dog, it's my dog.
11:28
(audience laughing softly)
11:30
Right, we do dog things.
11:32
Go to the park, you could give it a Frisbee, yeah.
11:35
(audience laughing softly)
11:36
Once in a while, lean down.
11:37
Hey, how you doing, you all right, good?
11:39
All right, get the hell outta here.
11:40
(audience laughing loudly)
11:42
it's a dog.
11:43
(audience clapping loudly)
11:47
I'm not dressing it up.
11:49
What's up?
11:50
Why's the dog got socks on?
11:51
(audience laughing loudly)
11:54
Socks, had a sweater, little hat,
11:56
little cell phone around his neck.
11:58
(audience laughing loudly)
12:01
Stop trying to humanize the animal.
12:05
It's a dog, let it be a dog.
12:07
In Los Angeles, this past year, they had,
12:10
for Christmastime, a Santa Claus for your dog.
12:16
150 dogs wrapped around the mall to see doggie Santa.
12:22
(audience laughing softly)
12:24
Two kids to see the normal Santa.
12:26
(audience laughing softly)
12:28
150 dogs, right.
12:31
And you got the idiot owners sitting there like,
12:33
"Yeah, Cooper, yeah, you're gonna see Santa today."
12:39
(audience laughing softly)
12:45
They put the dog on Santa's lap
12:49
and from the line they're like, "Go ahead, Cooper.
12:52
(audience laughing softly)
12:53
Go ahead.
12:54
(audience laughing softly)
12:56
Tell Santa what you want."
12:58
(audience laughing loudly)
13:01
(audience clapping and cheering loudly)
13:08
I'm looking at this, I'm like,
13:10
he just wants to lick his balls.
13:12
(audience laughing loudly)
13:13
(audience clapping loudly)
13:17
But he can't because he's got a sweater on.
13:20
(audience laughing loudly) (audience clapping loudly)
13:26
What's wrong with people?
13:31
But it's good, you know,
13:32
we do all this stuff during the day
13:34
and we come to nighttime,
13:35
we start coming to events like this.
13:37
Start bringing our lady.
13:39
Dating, it's fun, right.
13:43
The first date, that's the big one.
13:47
What do we normally do, guys, dinner, sushi.
13:52
(audience laughing softly)
13:53
Yeah, last week, first date.
13:55
I don't know what sushi costs.
13:58
I don't know how much it is, right.
14:00
Chicken, salad, steak, I know what that goes for.
14:05
A dynamite role, I have no idea what the hell that is.
14:09
Because what we're doing, ladies, on the date,
14:11
is we're trying to figure out
14:13
how much the bill is in our head
14:17
before it comes to the table.
14:19
It's a little game we play up here, right.
14:21
You don't know what's happening.
14:24
So I'm guesstimating, this is about $120 meal.
14:29
The bill comes, right.
14:30
And like a silence comes over the table, right.
14:33
(audience laughing softly)
14:35
So the bill comes, I do it a quick peek.
14:38
You know, the (blows out air).
14:40
(audience laughing softly)
14:42
It's what we do on the first date.
14:43
We don't look at it like it's a life insurance policy.
14:45
(audience laughing loudly)
14:48
We act like it didn't even come to the table.
14:51
So I saw the total, $256.
14:58
I closed it and then I started sweating
15:01
(audience laughing loudly)
15:06
on the inside of my body.
15:08
(audience laughing loudly)
15:13
Because on the first date, you can't let on that
15:15
that total might bother you.
15:17
(audience laughing softly)
15:19
You have to take that poker face.
15:21
(audience laughing softly)
15:24
But if you're married and you get a bill like that,
15:27
(audience laughing softly)
15:31
(audience clapping softly)
15:34
you'll flip it over.
15:35
Could you believe this crap?
15:36
(audience clapping and cheering loudly)
15:49
$250, what the hell did did you eat?
15:52
(audience laughing loudly)
15:54
You better take a good look at this place.
15:55
We're not coming back here again.
15:56
(audience laughing loudly)
15:58
(audience clapping loudly)
16:30
A lot of you guys tonight think this is your only stop.
16:34
(audience laughing loudly)
16:38
But it's the women, they always want different atmosphere.
16:41
They're into atmosphere.
16:42
(audience laughing softly)
16:44
Right, they'll leave here tonight.
16:45
You think you're going home.
16:46
You're gonna walk out that exit.
16:48
She's gonna turn to you like, "Where are we going now?"
16:50
(audience laughing loudly)
16:52
What?
16:54
We just did it, the Comedy Central, the fun.
16:57
What the?
16:58
(audience laughing softly)
17:01
So she wants to dance now.
17:02
Now dancing.
17:04
(audience laughing softly)
17:05
Now she's in her 20s, I'm in my 30s.
17:07
Women in their 20s dance a lot different
17:10
than men in their 30s.
17:12
(audience laughing softly)
17:13
Right, there's a lot of bending.
17:15
(audience laughing softly)
17:18
But it's that first date, right, guys,
17:19
we could do anything on the first date.
17:20
She's like, "Do you dance.
17:22
Of course, I dance, let's do this, right."
17:23
(audience laughing softly)
17:24
So she got out to the dance floor.
17:26
Right away, she starts pulling this move.
17:28
(audience laughing softly)
17:32
And she pulled a head whip.
17:34
(audience laughing loudly)
17:37
(audience laughing loudly) (audience clapping loudly)
17:49
I'm like, wow, I like this.
17:51
(audience laughing loudly)
17:53
I wanna participate.
17:54
(audience laughing loudly)
17:58
But I don't know if I could get down that far.
18:00
(audience laughing loudly)
18:03
But I'm already out there.
18:04
So I'm like, "All right, let's go, let's do this, so."
18:06
(audience laughing softly)
18:10
And my legs start burning.
18:11
(audience laughing loudly) (audience clapping loudly)
18:25
And all a sudden something pop.
18:27
(Sebastian blows out air)
18:30
I don't know what happened, a ligament,
18:31
a muscle, something fell out
18:32
(audience laughing softly)
18:34
and I couldn't get back up.
18:35
(audience laughing loudly)
18:44
(audience clapping softly)
18:49
And then we go, you know, we start doing stuff, right.
18:51
Going on vacations together, go to Vegas.
18:55
Something have, if you think you're
18:56
in a great relationship, go to Vegas,
18:57
test it out in that town.
18:58
(audience laughing softly)
19:00
Something about Vegas brings out the worst in people.
19:03
Went to Vegas, she was arguing right from the get go.
19:05
I went to go grab her hand in the casino.
19:07
I gave her a little static electricity.
19:08
She's like (hand smacks softly).
19:10
(audience laughing softly)
19:12
Pick your feet up.
19:13
(audience laughing softly)
19:17
What do you want me to do, float?
19:18
(audience laughing softly)
19:22
We went to the lounge, right.
19:24
I just grazed her butt.
19:26
You know, little (whistles) we're dating type of thing.
19:28
And again, (mic thuds softly)
19:31
don't touch my ass when we're out in public.
19:33
(audience laughing softly)
19:35
You were (beeps) my nuts the first night we met.
19:37
(audience laughing loudly) (audience clapping loudly)
19:47
(audience clapping softly)
19:51
You (beeps) nuts, you (beeps) nuts?
19:53
(audience laughing loudly)
19:56
(audience clapping softly)
19:58
That's what happens, right.
20:01
Text messaging starts.
20:03
Right, I had no idea I had text messaging.
20:07
(audience laughing softly)
20:10
Get in a fight with your girl,
20:11
you'll find out what text messaging is all about.
20:15
We had an argument. I left,
20:16
a little envelope came up on my screen.
20:18
(audience laughing softly)
20:20
I'm like, "What is this?"
20:21
(audience laughing softly)
20:26
It was a message from her.
20:27
I read it, it's like, "Why have you changed?"
20:29
(audience laughing loudly) (audience clapping loudly)
20:32
What?
20:33
(audience laughing loudly) (audience clapping loudly)
20:40
And I didn't know there was rules to text messaging.
20:43
I called her back.
20:44
(audience laughing loudly)
20:47
I'm like, "What's going on?"
20:48
She's like, "What the hell are you doing?
20:49
(audience laughing loudly)
20:51
We're not ready for this.
20:52
Hang up and text me back.
20:53
(audience laughing loudly)
20:57
(audience clapping and cheering loudly)
21:04
Nuts.
21:07
I'm not good, I'm not good with the thumb.
21:08
There's a thing on here that will help you though,
21:10
it's called T9 word, right.
21:12
This will actually guess what you're trying to say.
21:16
Don't use this drunk.
21:18
(audience laughing loudly)
21:21
Don't come home horny, drunk,
21:23
you want to text your girl a sexy message.
21:25
Look what you're typing before you send it.
21:27
(audience laughing softly)
21:29
I didn't look, I just sent it off.
21:31
She called me right back, she's like,
21:33
"Uh, what do you mean, you wanna kick my puppy?"
21:35
(audience laughing loudly)
21:40
Good night, my name is Sebastian,
21:41
you guys have been a great crowd.
21:42
(audience clapping and cheering loudly)
21:44
(upbeat groove music) (audience cheering loudly)
21:56
(air whooshing loudly)
21:57
(chimes twinkle loudly)
23:20
(upbeat groove music)
23:24
(singer exclaims softly)
23:26
(upbeat groove music continues)
23:31
(singer vocalizes softly)
