Yeah, I'm used to dating douche bags,
0:02
that's just like my thing.
0:03
My therapist says
0:05
I'm just in a negative thought pattern at this point.
0:07
So to change that,
0:09
she had me write down all the qualities I'm looking for,
0:12
very specifically.
0:14
And I did that and it helps
0:16
because it turns out what I'm looking for is a dog.
0:19
(crowd laughing) That's what I want.
0:21
I just want a man who's loyal,
0:24
pumped to see me when I walk through the door
0:27
and if he leaves me, he gets hit by a car.
0:29
(crowd laughing) That's it.
0:32
Pretty low maintenance on my end.
0:36
So I got a dog, that's what I did.
0:38
I got a dog, I got a girl dog.
0:39
I rescued her and-
0:42
Technically I paid for her,
0:43
but her name was Tina and I saved her from that.
0:46
So. (crowd laughing)
0:49
She's mine now.
0:51
I named her Miley
0:53
because my name's Hanna.
0:55
(crowd laughing)
0:58
So she's the other side of me.
1:00
That's correct.
1:01
She really is the drunk version of me.
1:04
You know, she pees everywhere,
1:05
puts everything in her mouth.
1:07
(crowd laughing)
1:08
And I don't drink anymore,
1:09
so I don't get mad about it, I get nostalgic.
1:12
(crowd laughing)
1:13
Like even at the dog park last week,
1:15
I felt like I was watching myself in my early twenties
1:19
because she was hopelessly chasing this golden retriever
1:22
while a pug ate her the entire time.
1:25
(crowd laughing)
1:26
And she just let it happen.
1:29
Rolled over actually and just
1:32
let him have it, anyway.
1:34
Do you guys think if we change pro-choice
1:37
to pro raw dog, we could get more guys on our side?
1:41
(crowd cheering and laughing)
1:42
'Cause I do.
1:43
Couldn't you see that on a bumper sticker on a pickup truck?
1:45
I feel like pro raw dog.
1:47
We're all out here.
1:48
No. Okay.
1:50
You guys are looking at me like I'm this huge slut
1:51
'cause I'm in a see through shirt.
1:53
Okay. I'm not, I always wait to sleep with a guy
1:56
until the third drink and
1:59
(crowd laughing)
2:00
I just worry about losing
2:03
rights to my body,
2:04
'cause I know men are going to the same way
2:06
and lie to us.
2:07
I know this because I was dating a man who gave me herpes.
2:10
(crowd laughing)
2:11
Yeah. And do you think he took responsibility for that?
2:13
No, never saw him again.
2:14
He broke up with me
2:15
because he said I made him feel too guilty.
2:18
And all I said was,
2:19
"I thought we weren't seeing other people.
2:23
I also thought you were Mormon.
2:24
What the?
2:26
Don't you have underwear that protects you against this?
2:27
What the?".
2:29
Yeah, so I've been raising my herpes alone
2:30
for two and a half years now and it hasn't been easy.
2:34
I guess herpes is less like a child
2:37
and more like a DUI for the pussy, you know?
2:40
'Cause it slows you down but it does not stop you at all.
2:45
I don't know why I was so worried about it, actually.
2:48
I couldn't believe that I thought men would stop at herpes.
2:53
Men don't even stop at the word no.
2:55
(nervous laughing)
2:57
So, if you're uncomfortable with that joke, that is you sir.
3:00
(crowd laughing) That's on you.
3:03
But yeah, when I got herpes I was so sad
3:06
and I know one and three of you know this
3:07
but you get very ill (crowd laughing)
3:09
at the beginning of herpes
3:12
and I got it at the beginning of covid,
3:15
so confusing.
3:17
I literally caught the wrong virus.
3:19
(crowd laughing)
3:21
I had to do my gynecology appointment over Zoom.
3:24
Okay? I was fanning my legs open.
3:28
It's on my Only Fans, check it out.
3:29
But (crowd laughing)
3:32
it was awful.
3:33
She was like, Yeah it's herpes
3:34
I can smell it, it's herpes.
3:36
(crowd laughing)
3:37
I was listening to that James Blunt song, "Goodbye",
3:39
you know, just mourning my sex life in my parents' basement,
3:42
which is exactly where you should get herpes
3:44
at 28 years old.
3:46
And I was so sad.
3:48
I didn't eat and sleep for four days.
3:51
I was manic.
3:52
I was like, what am I going to do?
3:54
And it got to the point where my parents
3:56
came down to the basement,
3:58
both my mother and father confronted me
4:00
and they say,
4:01
"Hanna, we're worried you're on heroin".
4:05
And I was like, "You wish.
4:08
You wish".
4:11
No, I had to look my father in the eyes
4:13
and tell him I had herpes.
4:15
And he goes, "Oh whatever, your grandmother had that".
4:21
And it was in that moment I realized,
4:22
you can always feel worse.
4:23
You can always feel worse.
4:25
But before I told my parents,
4:26
I was not going to tell anyone.
4:28
I was going to tell no one.
4:29
I was actually going to become a nun.
4:30
That was my plan.
4:32
I was like, that's why there are so many nuns now,
4:33
'cause herpes is so prevalent
4:35
that everyone just becomes a nun.
4:37
It was four in the morning
4:38
and I was crying and I didn't know what to do,
4:41
so I called the suicide hotline.
4:43
And the woman who answered was like,
4:46
"Why are you calling this evening?"
4:48
and I couldn't breathe.
4:50
I was like,
4:51
(whimpering)
4:52
"I have herpes".
4:54
And she was like, "Ooh".
4:56
(crowd laughing)
4:59
I'm sorry, did I call the wrong number?
5:01
(crowd laughing)
5:03
How is herpes the worst thing you heard today?
5:07
Anyway, I talk Pam down,
5:09
she will be fine,
5:10
(crowd laughing) but Jesus Christ.
5:14
I don't know if I want children.
5:15
How are we supposed to know?
5:17
My friends are all freezing their eggs.
5:18
So that's a whole thing with Roe vs Wade.
5:20
They're like,
5:21
"Ah, if I freeze my eggs, am I going to, ah,
5:22
if I don't do it, ah",
5:23
it's like a whole thing, you know?
5:25
And it's $14,000 to freeze your eggs.
5:28
So people keep asking me,
5:29
"Are you going to freeze your eggs?",
5:30
'cause I'm 30, which is offensive.
5:32
And I don't know, I don't know if I want kids.
5:35
And also $14,000?
5:37
I live in a studio with a mini fridge.
5:39
(crowd laughing)
5:40
I can't even afford to freeze
5:41
two boxes of popsicles at one time.
5:43
(crowd laughing)
5:44
So no, I'm not going to plan for that.
5:50
I think I want kids 'cause of FoMO.
5:51
I have pretty bad FoMO,
5:54
but I don't know,
5:55
I live in New York
5:57
and every time I get on the subway and hear a kid crying,
5:58
I'm like, "Absolutely not.
6:01
I can't do it".
6:02
And my friends who are all having kids are like,
6:04
"No Hanna, when it's your baby, it's different.
6:06
When it's your baby, you're going to love it.
6:08
When it's your baby, it's not the same".
6:10
And I'm like, "I don't know though".
6:11
You know?
6:12
'Cause even when it's my smoke alarm,
6:15
(crowd laughing)
6:16
You know?
6:18
That goes off, (crowd laughing)
6:20
I still beat the out of it, so.
6:22
(crowd laughing)
6:24
I don't know if I should have kids.
6:27
Yeah, I've been single for 10 years now and,
6:30
I know, that's surprising if you don't know me personally
6:33
but I was so worried about it,
6:36
so I got a therapist about why I'm single.
6:40
I'm like, "Is the problem me?
6:41
Is it me? Am I the problem?".
6:42
She's like, "Well that's a waste of time
6:43
for you to worry if you're the problem
6:45
because you are 100% for sure the problem.
6:47
You know, let's take the anxiety right out of that".
6:51
She was like,
6:52
"Hanna, your expectations are just too high,
6:54
even for yourself they're way too high.
6:56
Like you need to remember,
6:57
you're never going to be the richest person in the room.
6:59
You're never going to be the smartest person in the room
7:00
and you're never going to be
7:01
the best looking person in the room".
7:02
I was like, "hold up.
7:04
(crowd laughing)
7:05
There are only two people in this room, so,
7:07
(crowd laughing)
7:08
what are you trying to say?
7:09
You don't have a neck, Carol,
7:11
you're not hotter than me".
7:12
(crowd laughing)
7:15
I do think it is very important,
7:17
whatever way you're voting,
7:18
to remember that you got to do your research,
7:21
you know, more than Facebook.
7:23
I think a lot of people rely on that, specifically my aunt.
7:26
And (crowd laughing)
7:28
it's scary because there are so many liars out there
7:30
and the people in power,
7:32
they're always going to lie to get what they want.
7:34
And I know this because I went to USC
7:37
and I don't know if you guys heard about this
7:39
but the gynecologist there,
7:40
he had been molesting women since 1989.
7:44
And a bunch of women came forward in 2016
7:47
and the president just like covered it up because,
7:50
you know we have a really good football team, so.
7:53
Don't want to make the school look bad.
7:54
And I saw this man from my first pap smear
7:57
and I knew it was weird and I told everyone,
8:00
but they told me, pass me or suck, you know, live your life.
8:04
So I didn't do anything. I had nowhere to go.
8:09
And then four years ago I read an article
8:12
that hundreds of women had come forward
8:15
and this man had in fact molested them.
8:18
So I called the school to make a report.
8:21
I wasn't even going to sue.
8:22
I was just calling to support other victims.
8:24
And they have a man on their helpline
8:27
and he is challenging my story.
8:30
And he's like, "Well, how do you know?
8:32
How do you know you were molested?".
8:35
I'm like, "How do I know?
8:37
Maybe because I'm the woman
8:39
and I've had like a million pap smear since
8:42
and that's the only one that felt great".
8:45
(crowd laughing)
