- Comedy Central, let's go.
0:02
Y'all look good, like really good.
0:06
I look good, really good.
0:09
I'm still getting used to being hot and funny.
0:12
You know, just not a good multitasker so this is new.
0:16
I do feel good.
0:17
You know what?
0:19
I did put on some pounds recently, but I'm not mad about it.
0:20
You know, I've just been eating nonstop
0:22
'cause the oral fixation is real
0:25
when you finally kick that bad habit.
0:28
But I'm proud to say it's officially been three months
0:30
since I quit sucking dick.
0:33
(audience cheering)
0:35
I started when I was 19.
0:38
At first, I was in denial.
0:41
A lot of my friends sucked dick
0:43
so I'd say I was a social sucker, just at parties.
0:47
You know, I'll have one, two won't hurt, you know?
0:52
Classic peer pressure.
0:55
Next thing you know, I'm sucking dick alone.
1:00
Just to pass the time when I'm bored.
1:04
Wasn't until I went through a bad breakup,
1:05
that's when I started chain sucking.
1:07
Just everywhere I went,
1:09
people could smell it in my breath, on my clothes.
1:13
No amount of mints or perfume could hide it.
1:17
You know, I had a problem but I'm in a better place now.
1:21
You know, I still get the shakes, the sweats,
1:25
and the cravings, holy shit.
1:28
The cravings, especially when I'm drinking, you know?
1:31
'Cause back then, it was beer in one hand,
1:33
dick in the other.
1:34
It was just the perfect pairing.
1:40
I'm going to a Justin Bieber concert next week.
1:43
So that's where I'm at in life.
1:46
(laughs)
1:48
I've peaked, I've really peaked.
1:50
I was thinking about it
1:51
and a concert is pretty much a huge hypnotism.
1:55
Okay, we will do anything and everything
1:57
the person on stage tells us to do.
1:59
Like call and response is pure brainwash.
2:02
They will sneak shit in there.
2:04
They'll be like, when I say, hey, y'all say ho.
2:07
Hey. - [Crowd] Ho.
2:08
- Hey. - [Crowd] Ho.
2:09
- When I say pro, y'all say life.
2:11
Pro. - [Crowd] Life.
2:13
- What? No, no, no, no.
2:15
What the fuck did I just agreed to?
2:20
We're just so excited to be a part of something, you know?
2:25
When I say eat, y'all say ass.
2:27
Eat. - [Crowd] Ass.
2:28
- Eat. - [Crowd] Ass.
2:30
- Who first?
2:35
And there's always a point during the show
2:36
when the person on stage is like,
2:38
let's get those phones out.
2:39
You know, let's light this bitch up.
2:41
Turn those flashlights on.
2:44
I have 2% left on my phone
2:48
and like 13 pending Snapchat stories but sure,
2:52
this battery's not gonna waste itself.
2:55
I have to call an Uber home, but I thought you'd never ask.
3:01
I need to update that joke.
3:02
Are we still on Snapchat?
3:06
I have 13 pending MySpace HTMLs, I gotta go.
3:12
Okay, so we're all around 30.
3:14
Okay, class of '07?
3:19
I'm single.
3:23
Wow, this is like Hinge in real life.
3:25
No.
3:27
No.
3:30
No.
3:33
We'll be in touch.
3:34
You know who the fuck you are.
3:37
I'm just gonna start airdropping my nudes.
3:39
That's my dating app, just airdrop my nudes,
3:42
whoever accepts, it's on.
3:46
A lot of pros and cons to being single.
3:47
One of the biggest cons personally is the carpal tunnel.
3:53
It's rough, I'm telling you,
3:55
after one lonely night, I gotta watch where I go, okay?
3:59
My right hand is throwing up gang signs
4:01
for a good three days.
4:04
It's just stuck.
4:07
You know, I'll be in a sketchy neighborhood.
4:08
Like no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
4:11
I'm not, I'm not throwing up, I'm not.
4:14
No, no, no, I don't want any trouble.
4:15
This is M for masturbation.
4:18
That's the only thing I'm repping.
4:21
It's simply the clit walk, you know?
4:23
I don't, it's the curse of the coochie claw, you know?
4:29
You can't do shit with the coochie claw.
4:31
You can't shake hands, you know?
4:33
You can't fucking shoot hoops.
4:35
It's rock, paper, coochie claw.
4:37
That's my only option in life.
4:41
A lot of my friends are not single
4:43
and they're all getting married.
4:45
So all their weddings got pushed 'cause of the pandemic.
4:49
I'm gonna be a bridesmaid like four times in April.
4:53
One more and I get a free Boba milk tea.
4:55
Yeah, it's the stamp card system.
4:58
And a lot of girls love it.
5:00
But to me, it's exhausting.
5:01
Like I fucking hate being a bridesmaid.
5:04
At this point, I don't know what's worse.
5:05
Getting asked to be a bridesmaid
5:07
or getting selected for jury duty.
5:09
It's just the same, same dread, same burden.
5:13
When I open up that envelope, you know,
5:15
like I thought I just did this.
5:17
Why me?
5:18
And I wish I could get out of being a bridesmaid
5:20
like I could get outta jury duty.
5:22
Like I wish I could just show up at the wedding
5:24
and pretend I don't know English, you know?
5:30
Just call up the bride and tell her I hate cops.
5:33
Like how do I get outta here?
5:36
You're just forced to interact
5:38
with a group of strangers you don't know.
5:40
The bachelorette weekend is a fucking nightmare, okay?
5:44
Like they're always on IG Live.
5:46
Like how many champagne boomerangs can I do in 72 hours?
5:51
Just cameras everywhere.
5:53
Like what kind of fucking reality show did I sign up for?
5:55
It's literally me, the college roommate, the groom's sister,
5:58
the fucking cousin, the hairstylist, the summer camp BFF.
6:01
It's literally seven strangers picked to live in a house
6:04
and have their lives taped.
6:07
We are around 30, okay.
6:11
This is a Road Rules section.
6:14
I didn't mean to get into politics today, but.
6:18
My mom is pressuring me to have a baby like ASAP.
6:21
Like she wants to be a grandma tonight.
6:24
I think there's a sign up sheet going around.
6:28
I'm not a baby person yet, I'm not a baby person.
6:31
The way you're looking at me though, honey.
6:36
You named our kids already.
6:39
I'm not a baby person yet.
6:41
You know, a baby is way too permanent.
6:47
A baby is a tattoo you have to feed
6:49
and I'm just not ready for that life.
6:52
Like I'll say what's up to a baby, you know?
6:55
But I'm not gonna hit follow back.
6:57
I don't know you like that, I don't know you like that.
7:01
My mom, she doesn't actually have expectations
7:03
when it comes to who I end up with.
7:05
She is obsessed with blue eyes
7:07
so she wants me to marry someone with blue eyes
7:09
'cause to her, that means my baby will have blue eyes.
7:13
I think the harsh reality here is
7:15
that my mom never learned Punnett squares.
7:18
I don't know how to tell her.
7:22
So this is the biology convention
7:24
for the class of 2007, got it.
7:28
I took the same biology class
7:30
like seven times in high school 'cause I break stereotypes.
7:34
And it's fucked up 'cause everything we learn in biology,
7:38
like we knew we were never gonna see again.
7:40
Sometimes at Starbucks when they ask me for my name,
7:42
I say mitochondria, just to use it, just to say I used it.
7:49
Of course they always misspell it and mispronounce it.
7:52
We have a vanilla bean frappuccino for Marie Kondo.
7:55
Just, I'll take it, I'll take it.
8:00
Yeah, I really don't wanna disappoint my mom
8:03
but it's hard to find love, you know?
8:05
I'm bisexual and I, (audience cheers)
8:08
thank you so much.
8:10
Representation matters.
8:13
I'm bisexual and I also don't really have a type.
8:15
So it's all a gamble, you know?
8:16
It's all a gamble.
8:18
And it's really interesting when I date men,
8:20
especially non-Asian men,
8:21
'cause they're always shocked when they find out
8:23
I'm not society's bullshit definition
8:26
of what an Asian woman's supposed to be.
8:28
You know, I'm not traditional, I'm not submissive,
8:31
I'm wild as fuck, and that's the truth.
8:34
Like I'm down for it all, okay?
8:38
But there's one thing I will absolutely not let slide.
8:42
There's this guy I was hooking up with.
8:43
He comes over one night, steps into my apartment,
8:46
and off the bat, tells me he wants to try anal.
8:51
I'm looking at him like not so fast.
8:55
Shoes off, okay?
8:56
What the fuck do you think this is?
8:58
I'm Sherry Cola, y'all.
8:59
(electronic music)
