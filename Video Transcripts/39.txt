- Thank you, guys! (audience cheering) Thank you, thank you!
0:33
New York! Thank you.
0:39
Stop it. Stop it. (titters) How are you guys?
0:44
(audience cheering) Yeah, I am whoo, too. (audience laughing)
0:50
I'm feeling whoo. It's so good to be here. I'm in the prime of my life.
0:55
I'm in my late twenties, I'm 31, and it's just... (audience laughing) It's going great.
1:02
That's a woman's age. I am a woman, but I don't feel like one most of the time,
1:08
I'm still feeling like a girl a lot of times. I'm still relating to Taylor Swift songs on a level I definitely shouldn't,
1:13
(audience laughing) but my back hurts a lot, so I'm like, "Oh, (audience laughing) that's right, I can't shake it off."
1:22
I wish I could. I'm on Snapchat, but I Google bunion surgery every day,
1:29
(audience laughing) looking into that. It's weird, I feel confident most of the time,
1:36
but there are times where I'm like (whines). The other day I got jealous of a dog's thigh gap. I'm not proud of that. (audience laughing)
1:42
It's just like, "How does she do it? (sighs) I have to switch to kibble. Just gotta do it.
1:48
Bitch." I'm just not where I should be, I feel, as a 31-year-old.
1:54
I don't want a lot of things that girls my age want. I don't want kids. I do want a baby though, so it's like (groans).
2:00
(audience laughing) They become that, so... Yeah, I do want a baby,
2:07
but I feel like most women want babies, and that's maybe why so many of us exist 'cause babies are so cute.
2:12
Everyone wants one, they're like the puppies of humans, I've heard. I think a scientist said that once.
2:19
And that's all you hear women say when they're gonna have kids, they're like, "Oh, we're trying for a baby." "Oh, we're gonna have a baby." "We just had a baby."
2:25
"Baby." And it's like, "Yeah, I know, but eventually, it's just gonna be some dude named Doug. You know that, right? (audience laughing)
2:31
It's just gonna be a guy." (audience laughing) It's always, "Baby,"
2:36
but it's a baby this much of the time, you know it, and then it's all Doug. (audience laughing)
2:41
No one's ever like, "Oh, we're having a man." (audience laughing)
2:48
That's what you should say. Yeah, I don't want a Doug. I don't.
2:54
I mean, I babysat for years 'cause this family just never came home.
2:59
(sighs) That was difficult. (audience laughing) Babysitting is hard. It's like ugh! 'Cause it's like you're a mother,
3:05
but you don't love them, so it's hard to care. (audience laughing)
3:11
(laughs) No. I just feel like I'm past my prime to have kids a little bit.
3:16
I feel like I should have done it in my teens, that would've been the best time. (audience laughing) It's like they discourage it, almost exclusively,
3:22
but they shouldn't. If I had a baby now, my parents couldn't help me and all. They live in St. Louis, I'm in LA,
3:28
it would be too hard. But if you're in high school and you have a kid, you live with your mom and dad, or probably just your mom, let's be honest.
3:35
(audience laughing) Yeah, your dad probably split a while ago, but your mom's there.
3:41
She's hanging out, vaping, watching "Dr. Phil," something like that. I feel like that's how she busies herself.
3:49
She can help. You can just hand the baby to her and be like, "Here, Mom, try again,
3:55
he's yours now. (audience laughing) Yeah, you kinda fucked up the first time since that's mine and I can't drive.
4:01
(audience laughing) Yeah, his name's Mulligan. I really feel like you can nail it this time if you just focus
4:07
and stop playing the lottery." I'd have it over with, too.
4:13
If I had a baby when I was like 15, she'd be 16 now, probably have a granddaughter on the way.
4:18
That would be perfect for me. (audience laughing) I could handle life as a Nana.
4:23
That's what I call my grandma 'cause when I was little, I couldn't pronounce Old Bitch, so that's what I came up with. (audience laughing)
4:31
Yeah, I don't want kids yet. I don't wanna get married. It helps that my boyfriend doesn't wanna marry me, so that's convenient. (audience laughing)
4:41
For a while, he was like, "I don't wanna get married until gay people can get married." And I was like, "They can!" He was like, "Yeah, I never thought that would happen."
4:46
(audience laughing) I was like, "Oh, I thought that was weird you were protesting all those times."
4:54
He doesn't wanna get married. I don't really care, I don't need a big reception, I don't want a whole to-do.
4:59
I never wanna have to slow dance with my dad in front of all of my friends. (audience laughs)
5:04
Like, that's something we do alone together, and I don't wanna ruin that. (audience laughing) Thank you, yeah.
5:10
And what if the band doesn't know Ginuwine's "Pony"? Are we supposed to just freestyle to whatever they come up with? (audience laughing)
5:17
That seems humiliating. Uh-uh. I also don't like the fact
5:23
that when you get married as a woman, you just kind of give up your last name. It's nice to take your husband's name,
5:28
but then you're like, "Oh, this thing I've had my whole life that's my whole identity, that my great-grandparents came through Ellis Island with,
5:34
I'll just throw it in the trash. This guy seems cool. Bye." (audience laughing) What?
5:40
Your name is nothing after you get married. All it is is your shithead son's bank account security question answer,
5:46
that's all your name is. (audience laughing) What? (audience applauding)
5:52
Only time it comes up. Yeah. And he's gotta call you
5:57
'cause he doesn't even know it. (audience laughing) That's the one call you get from him a month.
6:03
"Mom, I'm locked out my account again. Hey, what's your old name?" (audience laughing) He calls it an old name.
6:09
And you're like, "(scoffs) You mean my maiden name?" He's like, "Whatever." "Uh, Jones." He's like, "Can you spell it?" And you're like, "Fucking Doug.
6:15
Like, Jesus Christ." (audience laughing) "Why couldn't you stay a baby?"
6:22
That is weird that that's the question that they came up with. The banks were like, "What worthless piece of information could we ask for
6:31
that no one would ever know about this man to protect his finances?"
6:37
And some guy's like, "What about his mother's name?," and they're like, "Perfect! Who gives a shit, right?
6:43
(laughs) His mother's name." (audience laughing)
6:48
That's the question. That seems like something people should know about you,
6:54
but it's that question and then your first concert. So it's your name and then your son's first concert.
7:00
Your name and Limp Bizkit are just fighting for the top spot. (audience laughing)
7:06
So rude! You're just like, "I don't really see it anymore."
7:12
Sometimes women get divorced but they keep their ex-husband's last names 'cause they're just like, "I just don't wanna go to the DMV.
7:18
I don't care." (audience laughing) Like, "I'll just live with this man's name I hate because I don't wanna wait in line." I get it. (laughs)
7:24
'Cause your name disappears. That's why I wanna marry someone with my same last name, save the trouble.
7:29
Not a cousin 'cause they're poor, but another Glazer, (audience laughing)
7:35
I could find one. But if we had kids, I would still make my kids hyphenate their names just to be a dick about it.
7:41
I don't know. They'd be like, "Mom, why are we Glazer-Glazer?" (audience laughing)
7:46
I'm like, "I don't know, I want you to sound like tiny little law firms, okay? That's why." (audience laughing)
7:53
"This is my son, Cooper Glazer-Glazer and Associates, his sister Associates." (audience laughing)
8:05
My boyfriend and I, we've been together like three years. We've broken up like three times, but we always get back together,
8:11
so we're gonna make it. (audience laughs) And that's really promising. (chuckles) No, it is, it's been good.
8:17
He broke up with me once 'cause he kinda found out I was lying about who I was
8:23
in the beginning of our relationship to kinda trap him into one. I was like, "I didn't know I wasn't supposed to do that.
8:31
But what if I don't like me?" (laughs) I really was pretending to be this version
8:36
of a girl that he would fall in love with. I was just walking around like, "What would Khaleesi do?" I didn't know what,
8:42
I was like he likes that show, I think. So I just walked around topless, got a bunch of lizards. (audience laughing)
8:48
I didn't think it through. I hid a couple things. I wasn't lying about who I was,
8:55
I feel like I put Spanx on my personality, (audience laughing) I was just tucking some things in.
9:02
I don't know. He's a lot cleaner than I am. We were getting ready for bed once, and you know when you're first hanging out with someone,
9:09
and you start sleeping over, and your hygiene habits kind of meet up, and yours is just not really up to snuff,
9:14
(audience laughing) but you just fake it. You're just like, "I always brush 'em this long, that's cool, yeah." (audience laughing) Oh, you get the bottoms, that's neat.
9:21
I'll try that. All right." (audience laughing) (groans) And then my arm is going numb. He's still going, and I'm just like,
9:27
"Cool. We're still doing this?" I get through that, I'm headed out of the bathroom, he's like, "You gotta floss."
9:33
And I was like, "You gotta floss, what am I doing? Okay, here we go."
9:38
And I'm just gushing blood, like, (laughs painfully) (audience laughing) "What?
9:44
This never happens. I must have hit something, this is weird, this is the first time. Both ends are on our period.
9:51
Is that not right? Okay." (audience laughing) Don't say that. (laughs)
10:01
We've been taking showers together recently, which is like mmm 'cause I just think he wants me to shower more,
10:07
so that's cool. (audience laughing) I'll take what I can get. He's like, "Let's get in." I'm like, "Whoo!"
10:13
He's just scrubbing my back a little too much, I'm like, "What are you doing?" I was like, "Do you wanna blowjob?" He's like, "Let's get your feet first."
10:18
I'm like, "Okay. All right." (audience laughing) I was like, "Do you have like a foot fetish?" He's like, "No, you have a foot fungus,
10:25
and you should get this looked at, it's of concern." I'm like, "It doesn't scrub off."
10:32
But he is a clean freak, you can't compete with that. He takes up to three showers a week, and it's like, "We get it, Dr. Oz. Ugh."
10:38
(audience laughing) But it's been good. I broke up with him the first time
10:46
because we were a year into our relationship and he would not say I love you. A year in.
10:51
And I needed to hear it 'cause my friends told me I did, so that's when you know. (audience laughing)
10:57
That's really when you know. I was trying to be cool about it 'cause friends talk about that. We're like, "Did he say I love you?
11:02
When's he gonna say it?" And I didn't have anything to tell them. I was just trying to play it cool, I was like, "I don't need to hear it."
11:09
I know he does, like the way he high-fives me after sex, there's no question, (audience laughing) you wouldn't just do that. (audience laughing)
11:19
They were like, "Okay. Well, does he talk about the future at all?" And I was like, "Yeah.
11:24
Like flying cars, robots, climate change. (audience laughing) We're all worried, he's no different."
11:33
But they were so mad. So I went back to him, I was furious, too. 'Cause that's the thing,
11:39
if your girlfriend breaks up with you out of the blue and you're like, "Where did this come from?" It's probably 'cause her friends got together
11:44
and decided that they miss her and they want her back, so they fill her head with lies (chuckles)
11:50
and send her back to you, (audience laughing) just like (growls). 'Cause I was so mad,
11:57
I was like, "Why don't you love me?," you know, in a super lovable tone. (audience laughing) Just crying in the street,
12:03
and he just didn't wanna say it. He was sweet about it 'cause he was very calm
12:09
He's honest, he was just like, "I can't say it." And I was like, "Okay, well,
12:15
let's find a good speech therapist, let's get you in a program. (audience laughing) Honestly, I thought this was feelings for you,
12:20
but clearly it's phonics, so this is such a relief." (audience laughing)
12:26
This is what he did say. He was like, "I can't say I love you." I was like, "You just did, I'll take it. Thank you so much, (audience laughing)
12:31
you can stop right there, that counts." (laughs) I've only had, really, two serious boyfriends in my life,
12:37
and the first one definitely did not say it on his own.
12:42
He was a blackout drunk with a twin bed. That second part's not really that important,
12:47
I just want to paint a picture. He was 30 with a twin bed,
12:52
and I would be like, "Can you upgrade to a full so I feel like a woman?" (audience laughing) (chuckles) That's all it takes.
12:59
And he was like, "No, it's an extra long twin." I was like, "Ooh, a California twin. Wow. Am I Rihanna? Jesus." (audience laughing)
13:09
He would get blackout drunk all the time. We were long distance. He would get caught making out with girls in bars back home where I was from.
13:15
My friends would see him. They'd call me, tell me about it. I'd call him the next day and be like, "What the fuck?" And he was like, "I thought it was you."
13:22
And I was like, "Aww." (audience laughing) I was flattered. "Was she skinny?" Ugh.
13:29
He was the worst. He came to visit me for Valentine's Day, and I was like, "Oh my God, he's so gonna say I love you. This is the trip."
13:35
I got ready, and I told all my friends, I'm like, "This is it!" And it was a great night, we went to this fancy dinner that I paid for,
13:40
and then we were in this alley (audience laughing) and I was rubbing his back as he vomited, (audience laughing)
13:45
and it was just like everything I'd wanted. He just got really sick and passed out, and I was like, "Oh my God."
13:52
He didn't say I love you, I think he may have said I hate you. It was the worst time. (audience laughing)
13:57
But I was like, "Wait a second, when he gets blackout drunk, he doesn't remember anything he does or says,
14:02
so I'll just make last night whatever I want it to be." This is true, I swear to God, I woke him up the next morning, and I was like,
14:08
"Hey, do you remember what you said to me last night?" He was like, "No, I'm sorry. What?"
14:13
And I was like, "No, you told me love me." (audience laughing)
14:18
And he was like, "I did?," and I was like, "Yeah.," and he was like, "Okay." That's it. (audience laughing)
14:24
He started saying it after that. I date raped to my boyfriend into loving me,
14:30
that's what I did. Thank you so much. (audience applauding) I took back the night.
14:35
(Nikki laughs) It was a pretty good plan.
14:41
I couldn't use it, though, with my boyfriend now because he doesn't drink. So I was like, "What am I gonna do?"
14:47
(audience laughing) "How am I gonna get it?" This is how I got it.
14:53
I decided to ask him to say I love you as he was coming, which is a great time. (audience laughing)
15:00
A guy will do anything for you in that moment, you just gotta time it perfectly. I was just like, "Tell me you love me." He's like, "I love you!"
15:05
It was like, "I got it!" (audience laughing) Just the once, but I got it, so that was pretty cool.
15:14
'Cause I thought about it, I was like, "Oh my God, guys are so vulnerable in that moment." They will do anything right before they come,
15:20
up until they come. I feel like my boyfriend would take a bullet to the brain for me. He would jump in front of a train for me.
15:27
He would do anything in a Bruno Mars song, pretty much, is what I'm saying. (audience laughing) Definitely.
15:33
I feel like Bruno Mars must write all his lyrics before he comes. (audience laughing) That's the only way he feels those things. (chuckles)
15:44
And then it is a sharp drop-off after that. Right after he comes,
15:49
I feel like in one second, he'd do anything for me, and then he's like (groans), and then I feel like he's like, "What have I done?"
15:55
(audience laughing) He wants to pretend it didn't happen, we can't really talk about it.
16:00
I'm like, "Tell me about my clit." He's just like, "No!" I wanna talk, (audience laughing) he's off getting a towel.
16:07
I'm like, "You can let it marinate, I don't care. This is fine." (audience laughing) He's dabbing me off, I'm like, "Are we having company?
16:13
Like, what's the rush?" (audience laughing) I'm like, "You know this was consensual, right? What are you doing?" (audience laughing)
16:20
So ashamed. He tries to close me like a laptop. I'm like, "I'm a real woman (audience laughing) with feelings and thoughts and a career.
16:27
You can't do this." (audience applauding)
16:33
I think it's porn. I think that's what makes guys so ashamed after they come sometimes,
16:38
'cause they're used to watching disgusting things, and they're like, "(groans) That didn't happen." But it did.
16:45
You did it. And I get it. Like, I don't mind that guys watch porn. They all watch it.
16:52
I don't care that my boyfriend watches porn. I'm on the road a lot, so sometimes I'll ask him to send me the porn
16:57
he's about to jerk off to, and then I'll sit there and watch it, just knowing that he's jerking off to it.
17:03
(audience laughing) I think it's romantic 'cause I'm like ♪ Somewhere out there ♪ (audience laughing)
17:09
like we're looking at the same moon. (audience laughing) It's beautiful, kind of. (chuckles)
17:20
I don't love porn. I watch it sometimes, mainly for tips. I'm always looking for new tricks I can try.
17:28
Especially when it comes to blow jobs, I feel like I'm not very good at 'em, so I'll check out a blow job video on like the front page, something very mild.
17:35
I'll be like, "Okay, this seems cool." And I'll just take some notes. Like, "What are these gals gagging about?," like, "Mm."
17:42
You learn some things, you're like, "Oh, okay, use both hands. I can do that, that seems cool. All right.
17:48
Look terrified. All right, I'll give it a whirl. (audience laughing) Wouldn't be the first time, you know?
17:54
Be fun to revisit, okay. Choke to death? Perfect, okay. (audience laughing)
18:00
That's how I'm gonna go, then." It's like violent stuff on the front page,
18:06
you don't even have to dig for the stuff. Every porn now is just like (imitates choking), it's like a girl just dying. (audience laughing)
18:13
When did this happen? I feel like I took a break from porn, and then it's all just slobber now. These girls have so much saliva,
18:19
and I'm like, I don't have that much. (audience laughing) It's making me insecure, I'm like, "These bitches look like St. Bernards."
18:25
I don't have this frothy, (audience laughing) foamy strands.
18:31
Do we need an extra gland or something? Like, what? Ugh!
18:36
I gotta be wet up here now? It's just too much! (audience laughing)
18:41
I hate the way porn has made me feel throughout my life. I started watching porn when it first came out in '98 and it made me feel sad.
18:49
Then I hadn't even kissed a boy, and I was like, "I have to do the hat?" And then I didn't watch it forever, and then I checked back in on it
18:55
when I started being interested in having sex. I was like, "Maybe I'll try it," and then I was watching it, and I saw porn vaginas,
19:01
and I was like, "Mine doesn't look like that." Have you seen porn vaginas? They're just these tiny, little,
19:08
it's like God's little whisper. It's just a little suggestion, (audience laughing) it literally is.
19:14
Sometimes I'm like, "Does that girl just have a paper cut down there?" (audience laughing) That looks like it would hurt.
19:21
I haven't looked like that since I was seven, to be honest, I remember. I didn't know those were my glory days.
19:26
(audience laughing) I should have just stared at it more and been like, "You got it, girl!" That would've been amazing. (audience laughing)
19:34
I squandered my youth. But yeah, those porn vaginas made me so sad about my own
19:40
because man, my vagina doesn't look like that. And I hated it for a while.
19:45
I was so furious. Every time I looked at it, I wanted to punch it. I was like, "Ugh!" And it looked like it had been punched several times,
19:52
so that's what's weird about that. I was like, "Why make it worse?" Sometimes I see it, and I'm just like,
19:58
"Were you in a street fight earlier?" (audience laughing) Picking gravel out. I'm like, "Oh my God."
20:03
(audience laughing) Do you know what I'm talking about?
20:09
Some of you have vaginas like mine, where you're just like (groans), like it looks like it's trying to escape, kind of.
20:14
Do you know what I mean? (audience laughing) Don't be ashamed. I have it, too. You could ask me how's it hanging some days,
20:20
and that's fine. (audience laughing) That's my body. (laughs)
20:26
You go to get a wax, and she has to go through it like a Rolodex. "Okay, let's go..." (audience laughing)
20:32
No one? Just me? Great. Great, feeling great about my body again. Thanks so much.
20:38
Yeah, I don't know. I'm not bothered by porn as much anymore. My boyfriend got me into porn, the industry, it's been pretty lucrative.
20:45
(audience laughing) I'm just dipping my toe in, you know? That's what I do, I dip my toe in girls' vaginas.
20:52
It's very niche, very niche. We've been watching porn together a little bit
20:58
'cause we finished "Friday Night Lights." (audience laughing) That's what Netflix wanted for us.
21:04
So we've been watching porn together, and he wants to watch what I wanna watch, so he's like, "What are you into?" And I'm like, "Well, if it were up to me,
21:09
we would watch a TMZ clip of Zach Efron getting out of a car." That's what treats mommy right, you know?
21:15
(audience laughing) That's fine for me. In terms of porn, there's nothing. There's been a couple videos that I'm like,
21:22
"Ah, I like that," but I always stumble into them. I wouldn't know how to search for it, it's too weird. I don't even know how to describe what I like.
21:27
He was like, "Try me, I'll find it," 'cause apparently he's like the Edward Snowden of porn,
21:33
he can just find anything. (audience laughing) But he was like, "Describe it. Come on, I'll find it." And I was like, "Okay.
21:40
Of the porn I've seen, the ones I like are the videos where the girl,
21:45
she isn't really quite into it at first. She's a little bit like, 'I don't know,' but then she gets into it.
21:51
But at first, she's just a little reluctant," and he was like, "Oh yeah, reluctant porn." He starts typing in reluctant. (audience laughing)
21:58
I'm like, "What are you doing?" He's like, "Reluctant porn." I'm like, 'That's not a type." He's like, "Yeah, it is." And it is. Oh, it is. (audience laughing)
22:05
There's so much reluctant porn, with reluctant in the titles. I mean, it's like "Hot Reluctant Sluts,"
22:11
and I'm just like, (audience laughing) "One of those words is not like the other porn." (audience laughing)
22:18
That one. Where did you learn that word? Have you been attending night school? Like, what?
22:25
"Reluctant." It's very hot, you should look it up. If you don't want to,
22:30
if you're a little reluctant to do so, (audience laughing) I do a pretty sick impression of reluctant porn,
22:36
so here we go. So this is all reluctant porn, ready? "No. Okay." That's it. That is it. (audience applauding)
22:45
Yes, slight hesitation, full commitment, yes.
22:54
I've learned a lot from porn, dirty talk wise, not physically.
23:00
My MO is I kind of just lay there. Like, I'm a bottom, you know? (audience laughing) And I'm enjoying myself, I don't wanna change.
23:07
I like being on bottom. I'm not a dead fish. I hate when guys call me that,
23:12
I think that's rude. (audience laughing) "Dead fish." "Dead fish!"
23:18
I'm like, "What? No no." I'm like a fish on its way out. (audience laughing) I'll give you that, I'm not doing great,
23:24
but like, dead? (audience laughing) Maybe someone just needs to clean my tank.
23:32
(audience laughing) That's what I call going down on me.
23:37
Thank you so much. It was really disgusting. (laughs)
23:44
Please, tonight, if you get gone down on, say to yourself, just for me, just go like, "Yeah, you clean that fucking tank."
23:51
Just for me. (audience laughing) It'll make you feel good, I know.
23:56
I feel like I'll feel it. Like my ear will tingle, and I'm like, "Yeah, a girl's getting her tank cleaned!" (audience laughing)
24:02
"Clean it! Clean it!" (laughs) I love that.
24:08
If you're lazy in bed like I am, you kinda gotta bring it when it comes to dirty talk
24:13
'cause I'm rarely on top doing things that are impressive. If I'm ever on top, I always do reverse cowgirl
24:19
'cause you can pretend his legs are Zac Efron's a lot easier than his dumb, stupid head. (audience laughing)
24:25
But if you're on bottom just chilling, say some good stuff. Now I have lines to say.
24:30
Before, I didn't. I would just be put on the spot, and I couldn't think of anything. He'd be like, "What do you want?," and I'd be like, "To check my phone.
24:37
I mean, to check your dick." (audience laughing) And he's like, "What?" "Something for crabs? I don't know.
24:42
Okay? I'm sorry." So go in with a plan.
24:48
And that's where porn comes in. You watch porn, you steal the line from that, and you use it. And I steal from Sasha Grey.
24:55
She's my favorite porn actress. She's awesome, she's so poetically filthy,
25:01
and I stole one of her mild lines from one of her Disney porns. (audience laughing)
25:06
The line was, "You own this pussy." I was like, "That's great, I'll use that."
25:12
I'd been looking to sell this thing off for a while anyway. (audience laughing) Please, someone take it.
25:20
I decided to say that, so we're doing it, and I'm gearing up, he's back there. (audience laughing)
25:26
Just wanna set the scene. He was back there, and by the way, I was not even doing doggy style.
25:33
Even for me, I'm like, "I don't wanna plank right now. Can we not?" (audience laughing) I'm always like, "Can we turn doggy into walrus?
25:40
Can we make this a little bit more comfy for old Glaze-dog?" (audience laughing)
25:50
I don't wanna engage my core right now, if that's cool, thanks. So he's doing it, I'm walrusing,
25:57
(audience laughing) and things are going great. and outta nowhere, I was like, "You own this pussy,"
26:04
and he was like, "What?" And I was like, "You heard me!" And he was like, "Okay," and he's like nervous (audience laughing) 'cause he's a first-time pussy owner.
26:11
I think he had just rented before, apparently. (audience laughing) It can be nerve-wracking.
26:17
So he was like, "Wah!" And I was excited, I was like, "Ah!" To be honest, I really thought that I would say,
26:23
"You own this pussy," and he would just immediately finish. Like, he would just be like, "I love you! Ah!"
26:28
(audience laughing) But it didn't happen that way.
26:34
He needed a lot more from me. It was hot, but he needed me to say more things,
26:40
and I didn't have anything else to say, that's all I had written written on my hand, so I was just kinda like, (audience laughing) "You own this pussy."
26:46
So I just started repeating myself, which works at first. You're like, "You own this pussy." He's like, "Yeah, I do."
26:51
"You own this pussy." "Yeah, I do." "You own this pussy." "Okay, uh, (audience laughing)
26:56
pretty aware of that by now. Care to expound on this situation whatsoever?"
27:03
So I'm just like, "Uh, it's in escrow. (audience laughing) We just put it in,
27:09
I don't know what that means," I'm just grasping at loose real estate terminology. "There's a spacious eat-in kitchen.
27:17
Contact Janet Russo to set up a showing. 917-425..." (audience laughing) He's like, "Are you giving me my aunt's number?"
27:23
I'm like, "I don't know! She's the only real estate agent I know." I'm like, "Check out the mud room. It's right above you, if you so dare.
27:31
Come on, please." (audience laughing) No. (chuckling)
27:37
Anal. (audience laughing) Anal.
27:43
Oh God. Do you guys do it? I do. (audience laughing) I love it.
27:49
I mean, it's good, you should try it. I always feel weird saying that I've done it 'cause people, I just feel, are like,
27:55
"Mm, we didn't need to know that." Or they're like, "I would never do that." But here's the thing, I've done research, 33% of women have done it.
28:01
So like all of these girls, that's just like crazy (audience laughing) 'cause I wouldn't think you've done it,
28:06
but you have, these are facts, so that's so weird, Mom, (audience laughing) just knowing that you've done that.
28:12
(audience applauding) My boyfriend bought me a sex swing.
28:18
I did not ask for one. He surprised me with it. I got back from the road, and he walked me in the bedroom and was like, "Surprise!"
28:23
And I was like, "Are you living with a handicapped woman that needs to get in and out of bed?" (audience laughing)
28:29
It's a big apparatus with all these straps. It really looks like how they fed the velociraptors
28:35
in "Jurassic Park," like when they lower the cows down and then they come back up and it's just swinging straps.
28:41
You guys know. That's a sex swing, I think, I'm pretty sure. It's fun, it's great.
28:47
I know why he got it because he's like tired of doing all the work 'cause I just lay there. (audience laughing)
28:53
I just plop in this thing, and then he just taps it once, and then you're just fucking forever. it's just perpetual motion after that.
28:59
(audience laughing) It's like the bird dipping in water of sex. (audience laughing)
29:05
You'll just fuck forever until a scientist comes and stops you. I don't know why that has to happen. (laughs)
29:13
But yeah, it's pretty fun. I found the box, and he hadn't opened the whole box because on the box it said "Free blindfold inside."
29:21
I was like, "Yes! A sleep mask." I love sleep masks. (audience laughing)
29:27
I wear them on planes, I need them. I'm a connoisseur. I leave them on plays all the time, though, so this one I've been wearing,
29:33
it's so good. It's the best one I've ever had, this sex swing blindfold. It blocks out all the light.
29:39
It does say "Cum Slut" on it, but I'm like, "That's who I am." (audience laughing)
29:45
Far be it from me to deny Southwest that information. (audience laughing)
29:51
It is weird when we land and I wake up, and I'm like, "I hope that's drool. I really, I hope it's drool. (audience laughing)
29:58
Please be drool." (laughs) I've said that so many times in my life, "Please be drool." (audience laughing)
30:03
I don't know why. (laughs) It's a weird thing to say. I am obsessed with talking about sex.
30:09
I apologize if it's not your thing, but come on, it's so fun.
30:14
We're all having sex, but we don't really talk about it. We'll be like, "Oh yeah, I've had sex before." We'll admit that,
30:20
but we won't be like, "Oh yeah, I've been like (grunts)," but that's what you look like. (audience laughing) No one admits that. They're like, "No, I look cooler."
30:26
No, you don't. You're just like (groaning). (audience laughing) It's just a bunch of skin shaking,
30:32
it's so gross. (audience laughs) And you all look like it, we all do. The only thing that differentiates us is
30:38
we put on clothes, and we're like, "Nope, I've never done that." Soon as you're not naked, you can be like, "No, I don't do that.
30:44
What are you talking about? I'm a princess." That's what's separating us, (audience laughing) is just clothes. You can give a sloppy blow job
30:50
and put on some jeans and a tank top and be like, "I've never sucked a dick in my life, what are you talking about? (audience laughing)
30:55
Nope, not me." And it's like, "Yes, you have." If you've worn a tank top, male or female, you've suck some dicks, that's just a fact
31:01
of tank tops, I think. (audience laughing) Yeah.
31:06
Pregnant women are my favorite 'cause you're like, "I know you doing it." Like, "You got stuffed. (audience laughing)
31:13
You got stuffed," you know it. And then, oh, you can find out exactly when she had sex.
31:20
All you have to do is ask, "When are you due?" Or pretend you care or whatever. (audience laughing)
31:25
You just do some light math and you count back nine months, and you're like, "July, you were just (grunts).
31:30
In July, you were getting it. (audience laughing) (laughs) You love it.
31:35
(audience laughing) Yeah, you should be ashamed of yourself." Like, I love that.
31:42
That's the thing about being pregnant. If you tell your parents you're pregnant, you're pretty much like, "Dad, Chris came inside me.
31:48
Come here! (audience laughing) I kept it in!" (audience laughing)
31:57
No, I don't wanna do that. (sighs)
32:03
I don't like how women are marketed to. Feminine wipes.
32:08
Feminine wipes are these things we're supposed to carry around 'cause they're like, "Hey, uh, your vagina smells like it's supposed to,
32:13
and it's grossing everyone out. Can you fix it, please? Thank you." (audience laughing) And we're like, "Oh, okay, I'm so sorry to ruin the party."
32:23
People are buying these. I don't know anyone who does, but I just don't understand why those exist yet ball wipes, we're like, "No, that's cool,
32:29
we don't need 'em." (audience laughing) I don't want balls to smell different, but it's just, we should be equally shamed, you know?
32:37
A fun, portable ball wipe, why can't that be a thing?
32:42
This is the thing, I don't want your balls to smell good. I don't, like, like the way they smell, (audience laughing)
32:49
I'm not like, "Mm!" (audience laughing) I don't want it wafting through my foyer,
32:56
I'm not dragging my boyfriend into Yankee Candle like, "Can you guys match this scent? Is there a way? (audience laughing)
33:02
With like a touch of taint? Cool, okay, I'll leave you here.
33:07
I'll be at Piercing Pagoda. Bye!" Like, no. I don't enjoy the scent, the aroma,
33:14
but I like that balls smell exactly how they look. (audience laughing)
33:20
There's something cool about that. They're just so authentic.
33:26
So they shouldn't smell good. You shouldn't put anything on them because we know that things are supposed to look how they smell.
33:31
We all know that from Febreze commercials. You know, where they set a person in a hoarder's apartment and they blindfold them (audience laughing)
33:38
and they're like, "Where am I? Am I in a whispering meadow? What's happening?" (audience laughing)
33:44
And there's like a rat crawling behind them in some trash. They're like, "What's that?
33:50
Is that a bubbling brook? (audience laughing) What's going on back there?" Then they take it off, they're like (screams).
33:56
(audience laughing) It psychologically fucks you up. Don't Febreze your balls. There's no amount of smell... (audience laughing)
34:04
I'm not gonna close my eyes when I'm down there and be like, "(sniffs) Am I in an Arabian spice market tonight?"
34:09
No, I know where I am. (audience laughing)
34:15
Your dick is in my eye. I don't really know.
34:21
But everyone knows about ball smell. It's funny to me that they attacked women's smell first
34:27
because ball smell has been around forever. Even before I knew what balls were, I knew what ball smell was,
34:32
I knew balls smelled. And so did you, think about it. You're a kid, right? And you walk into a room that smells a little weird.
34:39
You turn to your friend, and you're like, "(sniffs) Smells like balls in here, right?" (audience laughing)
34:45
That's a phrase that was based on your balls to convey a generic funk smell.
34:54
Your grandma could be like, "Smells like balls in here." You'd be like, "That's absolutely right, Grandma. That's a normal thing for you to say right now
34:59
because it does smell like balls in here." I think Chaucer wrote it, that's been around forever. (audience laughing)
35:10
I was having sex recently with my boyfriend... I hate saying boyfriend 'cause it's not like "Boyfriend!"
35:16
I hate it. My future ex-fiance and I... (audience laughing)
35:22
We can get there! No, we were doing it recently, and he said the funniest thing.
35:28
And this is how I know he watches porn a lot because out of nowhere, he just goes, "What would you do for this dick?"
35:34
(audience laughing) Great question. I was like, (audience laughing)
35:39
"Love it. (snickers) Are you Terry Gross? This is amazing." (audience laughing)
35:46
"What would you do for this dick?" He doesn't talk like that, either, by the way. Like, why do you sound like Batman right now?
35:52
It's just like, (audience laughing) "What would you do for this dick?" And I was like, "I didn't know
35:57
your dick was a Klondike bar." Let's start there. I don't have a plan. I was like, "I'd do a silly dance,"
36:03
and he was like, "Please stop, it's going down." (audience laughing) I was like, "Okay." (laughs)
36:11
I didn't know what to say. He asked it at the wrong time. You should ask that question before you have sex, right?
36:17
Like, "What would you do for this dick?" He's across the room, he's just dangling it, and I'm just like, "Anything! Anything!"
36:24
(audience laughing) That's why, I'd be like (panting). (laughs) That's how I get.
36:33
Real dick hungry. He asked it while I had it.
36:38
He's like, "What would you do for this dick?" I was like, "Whatever I did 10 minutes ago, that seemed to work. (audience laughing)
36:45
Sit on your couch and eat Thai food. (audience laughing) Mm, wait till 'Shark Tank' is over."
36:53
There's not a lot of hurdles between me and yo dick, you know? I didn't know what to say. (audience laughing)
36:59
I hope he asks me again because I just wasn't prepared, which he won't because I've done this joke.
37:04
(audience laughing) But if he does, if he says like, "What would you do for this dick?"
37:10
I'd press play and be like ♪ I would walk 500 miles ♪ (audience laughing)
37:15
'cause I would, I love it. (snickers) I do, I love it.
37:21
It's my best friend. So yeah, dicks are so fun to me. I like to compliment my guy's dick.
37:28
I did that very early on in our relationship, I complimented him, and I learned that there's only so many things
37:34
you can say about a dick that guys want to hear. It's like two things, you can be like, "Oh, it's so big."
37:40
Or like, "Owie." That's kind of it, (audience laughing) don't stray too far outside of that.
37:47
But that's hard because sometimes they're not huge. Like my boyfriend, not huge. Average, perfectly average.
37:53
I love it. It's wonderful. But it's average, and you can't celebrate that, you know?
37:59
You can't be like, "Oh my God, it's so fucking expected. (moans) (audience laughing)
38:04
Yes, fill me up with that adequate cock." (audience laughing) Not good.
38:10
So you lie. You lie, you know? You're in the moment. We were in the moment, and I was like, "It's so big."
38:16
And he was just like, "Oh, is it? (audience laughing) It's so big?"
38:23
And I was like, "Yeah," and he was like, "We're looking at this same thing right now, come on. (audience laughing) 'So big?'"
38:29
I'm like, "Can you just suspend disbelief for 15 seconds, maybe? And think to yourself like,
38:34
'Well, maybe she's only seen baby dicks, like she worked in a nursery her whole life and never got a date, maybe that's it.'"
38:40
But he was like, "Don't lie." I'm like, "Okay, fine, I won't." And then I just stopped complimenting it all together
38:45
'cause I was like, "I can't say anything." But then I realized, "Oh wait, I can say it's perfect." That's what I'll say
38:51
'cause that's not a lie. I think it's perfect. So now I say it's perfect. So if you've heard your dick is perfect,
38:56
it's average or below average, so that's just a thing I want you to know. (audience laughing) Yes, yes. (audience applauding)
39:04
(chuckles) Ya lady has found a loophole. (audience laughing)
39:12
I don't care that much about dick size. I know it's a thing, but I don't know, if I love someone enough, I really don't care.
39:17
And my friends are like, "Yeah, right!" And I'm like, "I really, I don't." And they're like, "What if he had a micro penis?"
39:24
And I'm like, "I don't know, there's other things. You can work around it. Like, you can cheat on him, you can use toys." (audience laughing)
39:32
No, there's other things. You have your hands, you have your tongue. At least you don't have a micro tongue,
39:38
celebrate that. If you have a micro penis, just be proud of your big tongue 'cause if you had a tiny, little (babbling).
39:45
How gross would that be if a guy was like, "Hey, baby (babbling)," like a little gecko? (audience laughing)
39:51
But he just had a huge cock, but he like (babbling). You'd be like, "Where's micro? I need him!"
39:56
Like, that is so gross. (audience laughing)
40:02
So at least your tongue's cool. I did get in trouble for lying. You shouldn't lie, and I know that.
40:09
We talked about it a lot, my boyfriend was like, "Girls don't know because they don't get compliments down there,
40:15
so they don't get it, what it feels like to be lied to." And I was like, "Yeah, you know, we'd like some."
40:22
And he was like, "Really? What would I even say?" "I don't know, like we're tight or whatever."
40:30
He was like, "(scoffs) Really? I wouldn't even think to say that, that's crazy." (audience laughing)
40:40
I'm like, "To me? Or girls in general? Like, what's the vibe here?" (audience laughing)
40:47
And he was like, "No, babe, you're perfect." And I was like, "Yes! Okay. (audience laughing) Oh, fuck you, okay? That's mine."
40:55
He was like, "Owie?" I'm like, "Enough!" (audience laughing) New York, thank you so much for coming out tonight.
41:01
You're so great! (upbeat pop music) Thank you, thank you, thank you! I love you, thank you!
