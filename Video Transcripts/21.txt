Well, in California it is really easy
0:56
to get your medical marijuana card.

For insomnia and depression.
1:01
Yay! (chuckles)

Well, Riki was hanging out with three friends
3:19
and they were all pregnant.
3:19
Mm-hmm.
3:22
And out of nowhere, one of them turned to me and she goes,
3:23
"What do you even do all day?"
3:25
I said, "What do you mean?"
3:27
She goes "Well, I can't just really remember
3:28
"what I did before I was pregnant
3:30
because it all seemed so meaningless."
3:31
Yeah. (chuckles)
3:33

So, Pat Robertson went on this show, The 700 Club
6:27
to discuss the gay marriage debate.
6:29
Yeah, and for those of you who haven't seen it,
6:31
you can watch it at like 4:30 in the morning on ABC Family.
6:34
And it kind of looks like a Canadian show.
6:36
Do you know what I mean? Where it's like (bleep)
6:39
but you don't know why.
6:40
That's... (chuckles) That's his show.
6:44
And he said on the show, if we legalize gay marriage,
6:48
it will lead to legalizing sex with ducks.
6:50
But he only said ducks.
6:52
Yeah, we kind of think
6:53
there are other animals
6:55
that are more in danger of getting violated.
6:58
Yeah, but then we thought about it,
7:00
and we realized he's totally right.
7:01
You know, two people
7:03
committing their lives to one another
7:04
and becoming a family
7:06
in front of all their friends and loved ones
7:08
and putting your penis in a duck: same thing.

9:09
So let's get into some (bleep), crazy (bleep), naked, alcohol.
9:13
(bleep) just got real."
9:14
And then he hung up.
9:20
The crazy thing is, you don't know this guy.
9:22
You don't know where he lives. Like, that is real confidence.
9:25
Like, he's just like, "You know what?
9:27
I don't even need to say where I am. She will find me."
9:29
(chuckles)

So one day, Riki and I decided to go indoor go-karting.
11:24
And I grew up riding go-karts,
11:26
but Riki had never been before,
11:28
and so I'm zipping around the track really fast,
11:30
and I look over at Riki, and she's driving so slow.
11:32
And then all of a sudden,
11:33
she stops in the middle of the track.
11:36
And I was, like, "What the heck?"
11:37
Like, what is going on?"
11:39
And then I found out what was happening.
11:40
Here's what happened.
11:42
Um, basically, I was sitting on
11:44
a big, giant vibrating piece of metal at a forward-tilted angle.
11:48
And, yeah.
11:51
And the faster I went, the more it vibrated.
11:53
And then I was just, like, "Uh-oh."
11:55
So I decided to go really, really slow.
11:59
But then I see Kate zipping by me,
12:01
and for some reason I thought,
12:03
"Well, if she can go fast, I can go fast,"
12:05
which I don't know why I assumed we had
12:07
the same vaginal sensitivity.
12:09
We don't.
12:13
I am a delicate flower. (chuckles)
12:17
And Kate is an unshucked ear of corn.
12:19
(cheering and applause)
12:34
(laughs)
12:38
Yeah, I said it.
12:40
Get in line, boys.
12:46
So, anyway... (laughs)
12:48
I just thought if she can go fast, I can go fast.
12:51
And I sped up, and then it was, like, "Nope, no, I can't."
12:54
And so I just pulled over and hung my head in shame
12:57
for the rest of our time.
13:00
An unshucked ear of corn, huh?
13:00
Yeah. (laughs)
13:02
Uh, well, you know,
13:05
the funniest part is you thought
13:06
that we knew what was happening.
13:08
Like, if you gave me a hundred guesses,
13:10
I would not have guessed that that is what was going on.
13:13
And also, if that happened
13:15

13:17

15:37
Thanks, guys.

(Riki laughs)
15:48
Um, so as you guys may have guessed, Kate and I are rappers.
15:51
(cheering)
15:51
Yeah.
15:54
And we're also very late bloomers.
15:57
Yeah. We kissed someone in, like, seventh grade,
15:59
and then nothing, nothing, nothing,
16:01
college-- kind of nothing-- sex.
16:03
And so we just skipped third base altogether.
16:06
Yeah, basically, we're really bad at giving hand jobs.
16:09
We never learned.
16:11
And once you're 30, no one will teach you.
16:13
So this is really more
16:14
of a cautionary tale.
16:16
You don't want to end up like this.
16:17
I was in a situation
16:19
where I was trying to give a hand job once,
16:20
and the guy was just, like,
16:23
"You know what? Just let me do it. Let me do it."
16:25
And I was, like, "I'm so sorry. I'm just not good at that."
16:26
I felt really bad.
16:28
But then we did have that nice fan,
16:30
and he saw that we had this problem.
16:32
He's, like, "You know, here is a link to a how-to."
16:35
And so I clicked on it, and there's only one step.
16:38
It said, "Use your mouth."
16:44
So, deejay, hit us up.
16:47
