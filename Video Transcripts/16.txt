THAT'S IT.
0:49
WHEN WE WAS BOYFRIEND AND

BREATHING OUT HER NOSE.
1:06
YOU KNOW WHAT MY GIRL DO?

1:12
NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR NONE OF HER
1:13
ACTIONS.
1:14
[LAUGHTER]
1:15
[CHEERS, WHISTLES & APPLAUSE]

SEE HER, YOU KNOW.
1:49
[LAUGHTER]
1:50
HE DON'T LIKE THIS GAME.
1:51
HE DON'T WANNA PLAY THIS
1:51
NO MORE."
1:52
SHE KNOWS HOW TO PUSH MY
1:53
BUTTONS, MAN.
1:54
GOD, SHE GETS MAD.
1:55
LIKE, I REMEMBER SHE TOLD ME
1:56
ONE TIME THAT I BETTER NOT
1:57
COME HOME AND GO TO SLEEP.
1:58
WHAT THE HELL IS THAT,
2:00
YOU KNOW?
2:01
[LAUGHTER]
2:02
HOW YOU SUPPOSED TO BE IN LOVE
2:03
WITH SOMEBODY, YOU TELL úEM
2:03

2:04
TO GO TO SLEEP?
2:05
SHE TOLD ME SHE WAS GONNA
2:06
CHOKE ME WITH A DIRTY SOCK
2:07
UNTIL MY EYES POPPED OUT.
2:08
[LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE]
2:13
A DIRTY SOCK?
2:14
[BLEEP]DAMN.
2:16
THAT'S NOT EVEN A WEAPON.
2:17
I WAS PISSED OFF 'CAUSE WE HAD
2:18
CLEAN SOCKS RIGHT THERE IN THE
2:19
DRAWER.
2:20
YOU CAN'T GRAB A CLEAN SOCK,
2:20
AT LEAST?
2:21
[LAUGHTER]
2:24
SHE'S SELFISH, TOO, MAN.
2:26
THAT'S ANOTHER THING THAT IRKS
2:27
ME.
2:28
SHE'S REAL SELFISH.
2:29
LIKE YOU KNOW, EVERYTHING HAS
2:30
TO BE FOR HER OR ABOUT HER.
2:32
YOU KNOW?
2:33
LIKE, NOTHING CAN BE FOR ME.
2:34
YOU KNOW, WE THE SAME HEIGHT,
2:35
SO WE WEAR THE SAME SIZE IN
2:36
CLOTHES, YOU KNOW.
2:37
EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE, I LEND
2:38

2:40
I DON'T MIND, I'M A NICE GUY,
2:41
YOU KNOW?
2:42
I GET MAD 'CAUSE I CAN'T GO

2:54
I'M JUST TOO STUPID TO FIGURE
2:55

2:57
"OH, BABE, YOU KNOW, YOU SHOULD
2:58
GET THAT SHIRT.
2:59
THAT'S NICE, THAT'S CUTE,
3:00

3:01
"THE TUBE TOP?"
3:02
"YEAH.

SHE TOLD ME SHE LIKED IT.
3:29
LIKE, SHE LIKES TO ARGUE WITH
3:29
ME WHEN SHE'S NAKED.
3:31
[LAUGHTER]
3:34
WHY DO WOMEN DO THAT?
3:35
I CAN'T ARGUE WITH YOU WHEN

6:26
BUT THE MINUTE THAT YOU'RE
6:27
SINGLE, DON'T NOBODY EVEN WANNA
6:28
LOOK AT YOU.
6:29
YOU KNOW?
6:30
[LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE]
6:32
YOU KNOW HOW I KNEW I WAS

I WENT TO THE MOVIES BY MYSELF.
6:34
[AUDIENCE SIGHS]
6:36
OH, SHUT UP!
6:37
[LAUGHTER]
6:40
I WENT TO THE MOVIES BY MYSELF.
6:41
THAT'S HOW YOU KNOW WHEN YOU'RE
6:42
AT THAT ULTIMATE LOSER POINT IN
6:44
YOUR LIFE.
6:45
ESPECIALLY IF YOU GO SEE A
6:46
COMEDY BY YOURSELF, YOU KNOW?
6:47
BECAUSE YOU CAN NEVER LAUGH
6:49
BY YOURSELF.
6:50
YOU GOTTA INTERVENE WITH SOMEONE

7:09
I MET THIS ONE OLDER WOMAN.
7:10
MET AN OLDER WOMAN.
7:12
AND YOU KNOW WHAT MY PROBLEM
7:13
WITH HER WAS?
7:14
SHE WOULDN'T LET ME BE A MAN.
7:15
LIKE YOU KNOW, SOMETIMES YOU
7:16
NEED TO BE A MAN.
7:18
YOU NEED TO DO MANLY-TYPE
7:20
STUFF, YOU KNOW?
7:20
YOU GO TO A RESTAURANT YOU WANNA
7:21
ORDER YOUR OWN FOOD AND DRINKS
7:22
BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT MEN DO.
7:24
WE GET TO THE RESTAURANT.
7:25
THE WAITER COMES.
7:26
HE'S LIKE, "SIR, WHAT WOULD YOU
7:27

7:41
"SHUT UP AND STOP BEING A
7:41
BITCH!"
7:43
"OH, MY GOD."
7:43
[LAUGHTER]
7:47
"I'M-- I'M GONNA TAKE THAT--
7:48
THE DOUBLE SHOT OF JACK--
7:50
WITH-- WITH A STRAW.
7:51
CAN I HAVE A STRAW, PLEASE?
7:51
[LAUGHTER]
7:54
IF I GET A STRAW, THAT'LL BE
7:54
GOOD."
7:55
[LAUGHTER CONTINUES]
7:58
SHE DID A BUNCH OF STUFF THAT
7:59
MESSED WITH ME MENTALLY.
8:00
LIKE, SHE KISSED ME WITH HER
8:01
EYES OPEN.
8:02
YOU KNOW.
8:03
I CAN'T STAND THAT.
8:04
IT FELT LIKE I WAS BEING SET UP,
8:05
YOU KNOW?
8:05
[LAUGHTER]
8:10
[WHISTLES AND APPLAUSE]
8:17
WHO THE HELL DO YOU SEE?
8:20
IS TORI IN HERE?
8:22
WHERE IS SHE?
8:23
COME OUT, TORI!
8:28
JUST IRKED ME A LITTLE BIT.
8:29
YOU KNOW WHAT MY PROBLEM IS?
8:31
I THINK I TRY TO IMPRESS WOMEN
8:32
TOO MUCH.
8:33
THAT'S A BIG PROBLEM I GOT.
8:34
I DO.
8:35
I REALLY DO.
8:37
TRY TO IMPRESS WOMEN WAY
8:38
TOO MUCH.
8:39
LIKE, I WENT OUT AND BOUGHT A
8:41
BIG-ASS TRUCK, JUST TO IMPRESS
8:42
WOMEN.
8:43
YOU KNOW.
8:44
DID YOU KNOW THAT EVERYBODY
8:45
LOOKS TALL IN A TRUCK?
8:46
DID YOU KNOW THAT?
8:46
[LAUGHTER]
8:48
I DIDN'T KNOW THAT.
8:49
I HAD TO FIND OUT THE HARD WAY,
8:50
YOU KNOW, 'CAUSE I LIKE
8:50
TO FLIRT.
8:51
AND ONE DAY I WAS AT THE
8:52
STOPLIGHT, AND I SAW THIS GIRL.
8:53
I WAS LIKE, "DAMN, BABY,
8:54
YOU LOOK GOOD.
8:55
WHY DON'T YOU PULL OVER, LET ME
8:56
TALK TO YOU FOR A SECOND."
8:57
SHE'S LIKE, "ALL RIGHT,
8:58
HE KIND OF CUTE."
8:59
HER AND HER GIRLFRIEND
9:00
HIGH-FIVE.
9:01
THEY WAS HAPPY.
9:02
[LAUGHTER]
9:04
SHE'S LIKE, "ALL RIGHT, WELL,
9:05
GET OUT.
9:06
COME TALK TO ME."
9:07
AND I CAN'T GET OUT OF MY TRUCK.
9:08
YOU KNOW.
9:09
I GOTTA JUMP OUT, RIGHT?
9:11
[LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE]
9:22
AND WHAT WAS BAD, IS THAT WHEN
9:25
I JUMPED OUT, I DIDN'T HAVE
9:26
A GOOD LANDING.
9:27
I STUMBLED IT A LITTLE BIT,
9:28
YOU KNOW?
9:29
AND ALL I HEARD WAS, "OH,
9:30
MY GOD, HE DOESN'T HAVE ANY
9:31
KNEES."
9:32
AND THEY JUST PULLED OFF.
9:33
[LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE]
9:39
MY FACE HIT THE SIDE OF THE
9:40
DOOR.
9:41
I WAS LIKE-- "I GOT KNEES.
9:42
I JUST"--
9:43
[LAUGHTER CONTINUES]
9:46
I'M HOLDING úEM UP.
9:46
"LOOK, I SWEAR TO GOD.
9:47
IT WAS A BAD JUMP.
9:49
I DIDN'T STICK IT.
9:50
[LAUGHTER]
9:53
YOU KNOW, IN GYMNASTICS, YOU--
9:54
AND YOU DON'T MOVE.
9:55
I-- OH-- AHH-AH!
9:58
SHE DIDN'T LIKE THAT TOO MUCH.
10:00
I THINK IF I WAS TOUGHER,
10:02
I WOULD HAVE BETTER LUCK.
10:03
'CAUSE FOR SOME REASON,
10:05
WOMEN LIKE TOUGH GUYS, YOU KNOW?
10:06
THEY LIKE TOUGH GUYS.
10:08
NOT THAT TOUGH, MAN.
10:09
I'M NOT.
10:10
LIKE, FOR SOME REASON WOMEN
10:11
DON'T FEEL SAFE WITH ME,
10:12
YOU KNOW?
10:13
LIKE, "SO, YOU'RE KIND OF A
10:14
BIG GUY.
10:15
IF A WOMAN SEES YOU, SHE'LL
10:15
SAY, "OH, I CAN'T--
10:16
IF SOMETHING HAPPENS, I KNOW
10:17
I CAN JUST GRAB YOU AND WE'LL
10:18
BE SAFE."
10:19
IT'S NOT REALLY THE SAME WITH
10:20
ME.
10:21
IT'S LIKE "IF SOMETHING HAPPEN
10:21
WE SHOULD BOTH GET THE HELL
10:22
OUTTA HERE.
10:23
IT'S LIKE--
10:24
WE SHOULD JUST RUN, THAT'S ALL."
10:26
[LAUGHTER]
10:27
"YOU KNOW WHAT?
10:28
YOU RIGHT.
10:29
I-- YEAH, WE SHOULD.
10:29
TELL YOU WHAT, I HOPE YOU'RE
10:31
FAST, 'CAUSE I AM."
10:32
LIKE, I'M GONNA GET THE HELL
10:33
OUT."
10:34
[LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE]
10:36
JUST NOT TOUGH ENOUGH, MAN.
10:37
I'M NOT.
10:37
YOU KNOW WHY I THINK I'M NOT
10:38
THAT TOUGH?
10:39
'CAUSE OF MY MOM.
10:40
MY MOM IS REAL RELIGIOUS,
10:40
YOU KNOW.
10:41
MY MOM WAS STRICT BRINGING ME
10:42
UP.
10:43
AND BECAUSE OF THAT, YOU KNOW,
10:43
I'M A LITTLE-- SWEET LITTLE KID.
10:44
I'M A MOMMA'S BOY.
10:45
I REALLY AM.
10:46
THE THING IS MY MOMMA'S
10:48
OVER-RELIGIOUS.
10:49
GOD, SHE'S OVER-RELIGIOUS.
10:51
YOU EVER MEET SOMEBODY THAT'S
10:52
OVER-RELIGIOUS?
10:53
TALK ABOUT GOD ALL THE TIME?
10:54
OR BLAME EVERYTHING ON THE
10:56
DEVIL?
10:57
YOU KNOW, THAT'S MY MOM.
10:58
EVERYTHING IS THE DEVIL'S FAULT,
10:58
YOU KNOW?
10:59
"BABY, THAT AIN'T NOTHING BUT
11:00
THE DEVIL.
11:02
THAT'S THE DAMN DEVIL, BABY.
11:03
THAT'S ALL THAT IS."
11:05
AND IT'S LIKE-- IT'S AT THE
11:06
POINT NOW WHERE YOU CAN'T HAVE
11:07
A CONVERSATION WITH THIS WOMAN.
11:08
BECAUSE IF YOU SAY SOMETHING
11:09
SHE DON'T AGREE WITH, SHE MAKE
11:10
IT SEEM LIKE IT'S NOT YOU
11:11
TALKING.
11:11
IT'S THE DEVIL.
11:12
YOU KNOW.
11:13
I HAD TO EXPLAIN TO HER.
11:14
I WAS LIKE, "MA, YOU GOTTA
11:15
UNDERSTAND.
11:16
I'M OLDER NOW.
11:17
I GOT MY OWN OPINION.
11:18
OKAY?
11:18
I'M NOT GONNA AGREE WITH
11:19
EVERYTHING YOU SAY.
11:20
SOMETIMES I'M GONNA THINK WHAT
11:21
I WANNA THINK."
11:21
AND OUTTA NOWHERE, SHE START
11:22
YELLING.
11:23
SHE WAS LIKE, "LET HIM GO,
11:24
DEVIL!"
11:25
"WHAT?
11:26
[LAUGHTER]
11:28
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?"
11:29
"LET HIM GO, DEVIL!
11:30
TAKE ME INSTEAD!"
11:31
[LAUGHTER CONTINUES]
11:33
"WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
11:34
THIS AIN'T THE DEVIL."
11:35
"YES, IT IS.
11:35
MY BABY WOULD NEVER TALK TO ME
11:36
LIKE THAT."
11:37
AND SHE START FLICKING
11:37
HOLY WATER AT ME, RIGHT?
11:38
JUST LIKE THAT.
11:39
[LAUGHTER]
11:41
AND WHEN SHE FLICKED THE
11:42
HOLY WATER, I GOT MAD AND
11:43
CURSED.
11:43
I WAS LIKE, "MA, YOU KNOW,
11:44
THIS IS BULL[BLEEP].
11:45
I'M LEAVING."
11:45
AND SHE FLICKED SOME MORE,
11:46
AND IT GOT IN MY EYE.
11:47
AND WHEN IT GOT IN MY EYE,
11:48
IT STARTED STINGING.
11:49
I WAS LIKE-- "OH, MY GOD,
11:50
IT STING.
11:50
I MIGHT BE THE DEVIL."
11:51
YOU KNOW, THE EYE.
11:53
[LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE]
11:57
SHE'S LIKE, "BOY, YOU AIN'T
11:59
NO DEVIL.
12:00
THAT'S BLEACH.
12:00
DON'T YOU EVER CURSE AT ME,
12:01
I'LL BEAT YOUR LITTLE ASS IN
12:02
THIS HOUSE."
12:04
[LAUGHTER, WHISTLES & APPLAUSE]
12:07
Kevin Hart: I WAS BAD, THOUGH,
12:08
MAN.
12:08
THAT'S-- MY MOM WAS LIKE THAT.
12:09
I WAS TOO BAD.
12:10
I USED TO MAKE MY MOM PASS OUT.
12:11
SERIOUSLY, I DROVE MY MOM CRAZY
12:13
WHEN I WAS A CHILD.
12:14
SHE USED TO PASS OUT 'CAUSE
12:15
SHE HAD HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE.
12:16
SO, WHEN MY MOM WOULD GET MAD,
12:17
HER BLOOD PRESSURE WOULD RISE,
12:18
AND SHE WOULD JUST PASS OUT.
12:19
YOU KNOW.
12:20
YOU COULD ALWAYS TELL WHEN SHE
12:21
WAS GONNA PASS OUT 'CAUSE HER
12:22
SENTENCES WOULD STOP MAKING
12:23
SENSE.
12:23
SHE WOULD JUST BE YELLING.
12:24
YOU KNOW.
12:25
"AH, KEVIN, TAKE YOUR FOOT OFF
12:28
THE REFR-- BOY, AND, UM--
12:32
PUT IT-- IN THE PIZZA BOX
12:34
BEFORE I SMACK, AH-- UM--."
12:37
[LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE]
12:41
[CHEERS AND WHISTLES]
12:45
SHE JUST PASSED OUT ALL THE
12:46
TIME.
12:47
I JUST WISH I WAS SMARTER.
12:48
THAT'S ALL.
12:50
I WISH I WAS REALLY SMARTER.
12:51
LIKE I WASN'T THAT SMART AS A
12:52
KID.
12:53
I WAS DUMB.
12:54
I WAS, I CAN ADMIT IT.
12:56
I DON'T CARE.
12:56
THINK WHAT YOU WANNA THINK.
12:57
[LAUGHTER]
12:59
NOT THAT MANY PEOPLE ARE HONEST
13:00
WITH THEMSELVES.
13:01
I WAS DUMB.
13:01
I WAS.
13:02
THERE, THERE, I SAID IT.
13:03
SO WHAT?
13:04
[LAUGHTER]
13:06
I COULDN'T DO MATH, MAN.
13:06
COULDN'T DO MATH TO SAVE MY
13:07
LIFE.
13:08
I REMEMBER ONE TIME, MY MOM
13:09
GOT SO FRUSTRATED WITH ME,
13:10
BECAUSE I COULDN'T GET A MATH
13:11
PROBLEM, THAT SHE CALLED ME
13:12
DUMB.
13:13
YOU KNOW.
13:14
SHE STARTED YELLING AT ME.
13:15
YEAH.
13:16
"KEVIN!
13:17

13:18

13:20

13:21

13:22
[LAUGHTER]
13:24
YOU CAN'T BE!
13:25

13:26

13:29

13:55
DO YOU HEAR ME?!
13:57

14:01
[LAUGHTER]
14:04
YOU EVER GIVE YOUR MOM THE
14:04
"I'M THINKING" FACE?
14:05
YOU KNOW, THE...
14:07
[LAUGHTER]
14:18
"13, FOUR"--"
14:20
"BOY, SHUT THAT-- SHUT--

14:28
YOU GOT THIS ONE AND THIS ONE!
14:30
THAT'S WHAT YOU GOT!
14:31
YOU GOT THIS ONE AND THIS ONE."
14:33
LIKE, THE MADDER SHE WOULD GET,
14:34
HER MOUTH WOULD JUST GET TIGHT.
14:35
"YOU HEAR-- YOU HEAR WHAT I'M
14:36
TELLING YOU?
14:37
YOU HEAR-- DO YOU HEAR WHAT
14:39
I'M TELLING YOU, BOY?
14:40
BECAUSE I SWEAR IF YOU DON'T,
14:41
BOY, IT'S GONNA BE SOMETHING.
14:44
NOW, LOOK AT ME, ALL RIGHT?
14:46
YOU GOT THIS ONE AND THIS ONE,
14:48
KEVIN, ONE AND ONE.
14:49
YOU PUT úEM TOGETHER.
14:50
YOU PUT úEM TOGETHER LIKE THIS,
14:51
AND YOU ADD úEM UP.
14:53

14:54
[LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE]
14:58
OKAY?!
14:59
YOU ADD úEM UP, KEVIN!
15:01
AND WHAT DO YOU GET?!
15:04
[LAUGHTER]
15:11
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
15:38
"ELEVEN?
15:39
I DON'T KNOW.
15:41
I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS."
15:45
"ELEVEN?
15:46
I KNOW DAMN WELL YOU AIN'T
15:47
GONNA-- I WORKED EVERY--
15:51
AND WHAT IF I COME BACK--."
15:54
[LAUGHTER]
15:57
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
16:03
Kevin Hart: I HAD AN IMAGINARY
16:04
FRIEND--
16:05
EVERYBODY HAD IMAGINARY FRIENDS,
16:06
THOUGH.
16:07
WHEN YOU WERE A KID, EVERYBODY
16:08
HAD IMAGINARY FRIEND.
16:10
THEY DID.
16:11
AND YOU KNOW WHAT?
16:12
I DON'T THINK PARENTS SHOULD
16:13
ALLOW THEIR KIDS TO HAVE
16:14
IMAGINARY FRIENDS.
16:15
I DON'T BECAUSE THAT JUST MEANS
16:17
THAT YOUR CHILD IS A STEP CLOSER
16:18
TO BEING CRAZY.
16:19
IT DOES.
16:21
THAT'S ALL IT MEANS.
16:22
IT MEANS YOUR CHILD IS ONE
16:23
STEP CLOSER TO LOSING HIS DAMN
16:24
MIND.
16:25
HONESTLY, THIS IS WHY I THINK
16:27
BLACK PEOPLE AND WHITE PEOPLE--
16:28
THIS IS WHAT I THINK WE'RE
16:29
DIFFERENT AT.
16:29
I DO.
16:30
I THINK WE'RE ALL REALLY
16:31
DIFFERENT HERE.
16:32
BECAUSE WHITE PEOPLE--
16:32
WHEN THEIR KIDS HAVE IMAGINARY
16:33
FRIENDS THEY GO ALONG WITH IT.
16:35
THEY THINK HE'S SPECIAL.
16:37
HE'S IMAGINATIVE.
16:40
HE'S GONNA BE SOMEBODY.
16:42
YEAH.
16:42
[LAUGHTER]
16:45
BLACK PEOPLE, IT'S NOT THE
16:46
THING-- IT'S NOT THE SAME.
16:46
WE THINK HE'S STUPID THAT'S ALL.
16:47
THERE'S NO GAME AT ALL.
16:48
WE THINK HE'S DUMB.
16:49
[LAUGHTER]
16:51
WHITE PEOPLE PLAY, YOU KNOW?
16:53
LITTLE BOY WILL COME OUT.
16:54
"HEY, MOMMY, LOOK WHAT ANDY'S
16:57
DOING.
16:58
LOOK WHAT ANDY'S DOING."
16:59
[LAUGHTER]
17:03
"WELL, WHERE-- WHERE IS HE,
17:05
HONEY, I DON'T SEE HIM.
17:06
IS HE HIDING FROM ME?
17:07
I DON'T--
17:08
[LAUGHTER]
17:09
I DON'T THINK HE WANTS TO PLAY
17:11
WITH ME.
17:12
WHERE-- WHERE IS HE?"
17:13
[LAUGHTER CONTINUES]
17:18
"YOU CAN'T SEE HIM, BECAUSE
17:19
HE'S ON YOUR BACK, MOMMY."
17:19
"OH, MY GOD, OH.
17:21
OH, MY GOD, HE'S HEAVY.
17:22
WOW, LOOK.
17:23
I CAN--
17:26
I CAN BARELY STAND UP.
17:29
LOOK AT MY LEGS SHAKING.
17:30
OH, MY GOD, HE'S--
17:31
HE'S SO HEAVY.
17:32
IS HE HUNGRY, HONEY?
17:33
LET'S FEED HIM BROWNIES.
17:34
LET'S GO FEED HIM."
17:35
[LAUGHTER]
17:37
THE MOM BAKES BROWNIES, COMES
17:38
OUT AND FEEDS HIM.
17:39
"HERE, DOES HE LIKE THEM?"
17:40
THEY'RE FALLING ON THE FLOOR.
17:41
[THUMPING SOUND]
17:42
[LAUGHTER]
17:43
"HE LOVES THEM, MOMMY.
17:44
HE LIKES THEM.
17:45
IT'S GREAT."
17:47
I DON'T GIVE A DAMN WHAT YOU
17:48
SAY.
17:48
ANY TIME I A CHILD COMES AT YOU
17:49
AND STARES AT YOU WITHOUT
17:50
BLINKING, GET THE HELL OUT THE
17:51
HOUSE.
17:52
SOMETHING GETTING READY TO
17:52
HAPPEN.
17:54
HE GOT A BOMB OR SOMETHING IN
17:55
THERE.
17:55
RUN.
17:56
THAT'S ALL I'M SAYING.
17:57
BUT IT DOESN'T HAPPEN THE SAME
17:58
WITH BLACK PEOPLE.
17:59
IT'S NOT THE SAME.
18:00
YOU KNOW.
18:01
BLACK PEOPLE, IT'S DIFFERENT.
18:02
A LITTLE BOY WILL COME OUT,
18:02
YOU KNOW.
18:03
"HEY-- HEY, MOM.
18:05
HA-HA!
18:07
AH!
18:08
HA-HA-HA!
18:09
MA!
18:10
[LAUGHTER]
18:12
MA!"
18:15
'CAUSE BLACK PEOPLE DON'T
18:15
REALLY LISTEN TO THEIR KIDS
18:16
THAT MUCH.
18:17
[LAUGHTER]
18:18
"MA!
18:21
LOOK-- LOOK WHAT MALCOLM DOING,
18:22
MOM.
18:23
HE CRAZY.
18:23
LOOK AT HIM, PLAYING HIS STUFF.
18:25
LOOK HOW CRAZY HE IS."
18:25
[LAUGHTER]
18:31
"WELL, WHERE--
18:34
WELL, WHERE THE HELL IS
