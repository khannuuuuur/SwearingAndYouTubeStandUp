0:21
Hey!
0:24
Hey!
0:28
Oh, my God. Calm down, calm down.
0:35
Thank you. Thank you.
0:39
I was talking to my grandmother the other day.
0:41
I wasn't feeling well. I had some congestion and stuff.
0:43
I always call my grandmother 'cause she knows all the things.
0:46
Like, old black women from the South,
0:48
they know everything.
0:49
Get a garlic.
0:52
Get a tube sock.
0:55
Cure cancer.
0:58
I love her. She's super adorable.
0:59
I got her a phone for Christmas.
1:02
Don't do that with your grandma,
1:03
especially if they love the Lord, okay?
1:05
She keeps texting me Bible verses.
1:07
I'm like, "Bitch, I don't need to read Leviticus.
1:09
I got a phone, okay?
1:10
I don't need all of Leviticus."
1:16
I'm single.
1:18
( cheers and applause )
1:20
Look at the single bitches. "We have another one!"
1:26
I'm single. I'm trying to get, like, I don't want to be sin--
1:28
'cause people get in your business when you're single,
1:31
you know? Like, my grandmother's like, "We praying for you.
1:37
Ya ain't got no man. We pray--
1:39
you're not gay, is ya? 'Cause we ain't never seen
1:43
not even a hint of a man."
1:46
She gets very confused.
1:49
"We're praying for ya at the church.
1:54
We put you on a prayer list."
1:58
Oh, you put me on a prayer list?
2:04
So you got the whole church involved...
2:09
in my situation?
2:13
Do me a favor...
2:14
get my pussy off the prayer list.
2:20
'Cause they nosy at my church. They no--
2:22
I know what happens. They have the prayer list.
2:24
'Cause they always have this old lady come up
2:26
and do the announcements and everything.
2:28
She walking up 90 years old.
2:30
You're like, "Is Harriet Tubman back? What's going on?
2:33
She's alive?"
2:36
You know, she walking up all slow
2:39
like she's bothered, you know?
2:43
( exhales deeply )
2:45
"How are ya doing, everybody?
2:50
Welcome to...
2:52
Trinity Praise Center Gospel
2:54
Chicken-fry And Hair Salon."
2:57
You know, black people, we gotta multitask, you know?
3:00
"Get your chicken fried on Saturday
3:02
and get your taxes done on Wednesday.
3:07
Got some announcements and some prayer lists.
3:09
We're gonna read about the prayer list.
3:12
All right, uh, got sister Pam.
3:15
Sister Pam back on the prayer list.
3:19
She back in the hospital. She got Type 2 Diabetes again.
3:24
I done told her about eating them Entenmann cakes.
3:28
But she don't wanna listen, so she back up in there. Her sugar
3:34
is high. Go in there and visit. I think the Lord might take
3:37
her this time. She's in the same room that she was in before.
3:44
Uh-oh. Look like-- look like Ricky back in jail.
3:50
I done told them Ricky wasn't going to be shit. I knew it!
3:54
He was running around here three years old looking like a crazy
3:59
person. Well, they back in jail. You pray for 'em if you want,
4:01
but I ain't wasting none of my prayers!
4:02
No, no, no! I'm too old!
4:05
I've been praying for this nigga for 19 years!
4:07
I'm not doing it no more! I'm tired!
4:15
Oh, my God.
4:18
Whoo!
4:22
Reverend? Is th--
4:26
We got a new entry this week.
4:31
She's such a nice, young girl.
4:32
I didn't know. This is so sad.
4:37
Look like Yamaneika can't get no dick.
4:47
Everybody touch and-- touch and agree and say,
4:50
'Jesus, bring her some dick. Just a touch of dick, Jesus.'"
4:53
♪ Just a touch of dick would do, Lord ♪
4:57
♪ Just a touch of dick will do ♪
5:11
I think I might be going to hell for this, I'm sorry.
5:18
The big girl's killing it. Look at you.
5:19
You looking real fly.
5:21
Fashion Nova? No, no, no. We can't do Fashion Nova, right?
5:24
Lane Bryant, all them big bitches.
5:26
We don't know who the hell they are.
5:28
Ashley Stewart-- if I sneeze,
5:30
I'm gonna get right out of this damn catsuit. You don't
5:35
understand. I had to set it and forget it, okay?
5:37
Like, my-- I had to put spanx on.
5:42
You don't know what big girls go through.
5:43
I had to literally-- like, you have to jiggle.
5:48
( laughter, cheers )
5:54
But I'm out. I'm free. I'm free.
5:56
Like, I'm not even ashamed anymore to tell people that I
6:00
want sex. I want sex!
6:03
I want it, I need it, I need it!
6:07
And they always go-- they go, "Oh, no. Oh.
6:09
These female comics, they always talking about sex."
6:12
That's 'cause we want it!
6:15
Yeah, I'ma talk about it. Listen, let me tell you
6:18
something. I was 27 years old when I lost my virginity.
6:22
- You hear me? 27! - ( applause )
6:26
Don't clap for that. That was sad.
6:30
There's no honor in that.
6:32
Zelda didn't come out and give me a sword 'cause I did that.
6:40
27. 'Cause my grandmother was in my ear.
6:43
My grandmother was a pastor. She was in my ear.
6:45
"You better not have no sex.
6:47
You know Jesus is watching."
6:51
Hey, why Jesus so nosy?
6:54
Why he-- I just want a pinkie up there, Lord.
6:56
Just turn around. I mean--
6:59
You know how difficult when I had sex for the first time
7:02
and the guy called out "Jesus."
7:04
I was like, "Where? Where he at?
7:05
Get your dick out of me! Where he at?
7:07
Where he at? Take your balls out, too."
7:10
'Cause you know Jesus invisible. I don't know where he at.
7:18
27 is too long. It's too long to wait.
7:21
Really is. Get out there and have sex.
7:24
You got-- I remember, you see, 'cause it was 27.
7:28
If I had lost it earlier, I would have forgot by now how
7:33
horrible it was. But I remember 'cause it was-- like it was
7:35
yesterday. 'Cause it was. It was yesterday.
7:37
Yeah.
7:39
Took it out.
7:41
I had romanticized sex so much,
7:43
I thought this guy was gonna come in on a white horse
7:48
and swoop me. Like, swoop!
7:50
I don't know why I thought that 'cause I'm a big girl.
7:52
So I don't know why I thought he was gonna swoop me.
7:55
And him and the horse wasn't both gonna down,
7:57
you know what I'm saying, like--
7:59
Damn horse come here... ( whinnying )
8:02
Always got these big bitches. ( whinnying )
8:11
I had sex. It was fine. It was fine.
8:15
It was weird. It was weird!
8:18
But it was fine. It was weird.
8:20
But fine.
8:24
Here's what happened.
8:26
That was the first time I had seen a penis.
8:33
It's not like the books.
8:37
It's not like the books.
8:39
This guy's dick was curved.
8:44
Up and over.
8:46
Up... and over, and I was like,
8:50
"I don't know if my shit is curved inside.
8:52
I don't know how..."
8:56
My pussy ain't "Tetris," you know what I'm saying?
8:58
Like, I don't know... boop-boop-boo-doo-doo
9:01
boop-boop-boo-doo-doo boop-boop-boo-doo-doo.
9:08
I didn't know how I was gonna have sex with him.
9:09
Do I have to go around the corner so he can fuck me?
9:11
I don't know!
9:19
He was showing me his penis for the first time.
9:22
And he had so much pressure. You guys put on a lot of pressure.
9:26
"Oh, I'm an man.
9:28
So much pressure."
9:31
And then we women go, "Oh, no. Don't have any pressure.
9:34
Don't have any pressure."
9:36
Like we don't have pressure.
9:38
See, the thing is, guys, they get uncomfortable
9:40
because they don't know if they dick is gonna do what it has to
9:45
do, right? Right? So you go cut the lights off,
9:48
turn the heat up. You know?
9:55
But men don't have as much pressure as women have.
9:59
And we never talk about this as women.
10:01
We have a lot of pressure when we see a penis for the first
10:03
time because, like, no matter what he pulls out,
10:05
our face can't change, right?
10:08
He can pull out-- Ahh! Ahh!
10:11
( chuckles ) Yeah!
10:15
Whoo!
10:17
Mm-hmm.
10:26
You ever go down on a man whose penis is so small
10:29
you feel like you want to fill out a W-9
10:31
so you can get money at the end of that?
10:36
"I need some money after this."
10:41
Now I'm sleeping with a bunch of different guys.
10:43
I have one guy that I like in particular.
10:45
He finds out that I'm sleeping with other guys
10:47
and he's upset.
10:49
How could I do that?
10:51
How could I do that?
10:53
We just having sex, sir.
10:59
You have not made a commitment to me.
11:03
You have done none of the things
11:05
that Beyoncé told you to do in "Lemonade," okay?
11:07
I'm just telling you, you haven't.
11:09
She told you.
11:10
( cheers, applause )
11:13
So, yes, I am sleeping with other men, okay?
11:18
But you have to put it in sports terms for guys when you do that.
11:21
You go, "Listen, I'm still sleeping with you.
11:24
You're on the team.
11:27
Right?
11:29
I mean, you're not the MVP, but you're suiting up.
11:31
You getting dirty. You'll get a ring."
11:35
I won't be-- I won't be slut-shamed
11:37
'cause it took me too long to have sex.
11:39
I'm not gonna be slut-shamed. But, see, here's what happens.
11:41
This is why slut-shaming happens.
11:43
Because men think about sex differently than women, right?
11:46
There's different standards for men and women.
11:48
Men will go around and say, "Yeah,
11:51
I want a woman that's pure.
11:54
Chaste.
11:56
A virgin, have you," right?
11:59
'Cause they want to be the first one to get in and get out.
12:02
They don't want to be compared to no one, right?
12:04
But women, we don't have the same thing.
12:05
No woman wants a man that's a virgin.
12:09
No woman.
12:12
Uh-uh. You a virgin?
12:14
Oh, no, no, no. You're not gonna go in here and mess my shit up.
12:17
You better go fuck a hundred other women.
12:21
Come back here when you get it right.
12:24
This ain't no practice test. No, no, no.
12:26
This is the main event, motherfucker.
12:27
Come back.
12:30
I went through a rite of passage recently.
12:33
I was a maid of honor.
12:35
- ( applause ) - Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.
12:37
I don't know why you clap for that. It was no honor, okay?
12:40
No honor. Every day, I went to the mailbox
12:42
looking for my honor certificate. It never came.
12:46
My friend got married.
12:48
My last best friend got married.
12:50
I was so upset, 'cause she's unattractive.
12:52
And, uh...
12:55
It ain't nothing like seeing a ugly bitch walking to happiness.
13:02
Knowing that you had to kick your cats out of the room
13:04
the night before to masturbate.
13:05
That really puts things in perspective.
13:13
I was her maid of honor, right?
13:16
Honor.
13:18
All it was was me being there
13:20
for her emotionally for six months
13:23
telling her that she was beautiful.
13:24
I was like, "I can't. I got two cats with sleep apnea.
13:27
I need a hug. I can't be here for you."
13:33
I spent close to $3,000 on this wedding.
13:35
$3,000 throwing parties, buying dresses.
13:37
And my pussy was dry the whole time. I was so upset.
13:41
I said, "Somebody better eat me out after all this money.
13:43
I don't care if it's your grandfather. Get him ready,
13:46
okay? Put a bib on him, get him ready."
13:54
I had to go to this dress fitting.
13:55
It was my first time going to a dress fitting.
13:58
I prepared myself. I went and watched
14:00
"Say Yes To the Dress"
14:01
to see how it was gonna go down.
14:03
It's not reality, it's not reality.
14:05
"Say Yes To the Dress" is 30 minutes, commercial break,
14:08
you're one and you're done.
14:10
In real life, five hours with this bitch working my nerves.
14:15
And they gay guy kept walking in trying to upsell with
14:18
his gayness. "Yass, queen! Yass!"
14:21
And I'm like, "Listen, slow down.
14:22
I suck dick, too, and I don't do all that.
14:24
Calm down. She's buying a dress."
14:34
Those brides are competitive. They are very competitive.
14:37
There's ten brides in there. They all want the same dress.
14:40
Regardless of body type, they all want the same dress.
14:44
My friend's like, "I want that dress, too."
14:46
They had a little strapless dress floating around.
14:48
And her mother's like, "You're gonna be beautiful. You get
14:51
that dress." I said, "Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Whoa.
14:54
You don't need that dress."
14:56
Everybody's like, "Be quiet. Shh. It's her day.
15:01
She's gonna be beautiful. It's her day."
15:02
I said, "Wait a minute.
15:04
I'm the maid of honor. I gotta have honor here.
15:07
Okay? Bitch, you built like a truck.
15:10
You don't need to be in that dress."
15:12
Come on, we all big bitches here. Come on! Come on!
15:15
You're not even built like a Ford.
15:17
You're built like a milk truck that travels across the country
15:19
with a refrigerator all over the place.
15:22
I mean, am I being real or what? Okay?
15:26
You need straps.
15:30
Matter of fact, you need to go back in the back
15:32
and see if they got two midgets to hold your shit up all day.
15:34
That's how much support you need.
15:43
We had to pick out our dresses.
15:46
She goes, "You pick out whatever style you want.
15:49
Whatever style you want. Just my-- have my favorite color.
15:52
Whatever style."
15:54
I said, "All right.
15:55
What's your favorite color?"
15:57
"Pumpkin spice."
16:09
That's not even a col-- that's a drink at Starbucks.
16:15
Wait a minute. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
16:17
You got seven big bitches in your wedding,
16:23
and you choose pumpkin spice? We looked like
16:28
angry jack-o'-lanterns walking down the aisle.
16:35
Boo!
16:37
Boo!
16:42
I get to the wedding.
16:46
Standing next to her, watching my best friend get married.
16:50
Not paying attention at all.
16:54
I'm thinking about the food later. I don't care.
16:55
Go do your thing, girl.
16:58
I ain't getting dick outta this.
16:59
Do your thing.
17:02
What happens is she starts to cry
17:04
and she starts to have a meltdown,
17:05
like she's so in love with him.
17:07
( imitates crying )
17:14
"I love you so much, I just--
17:18
You...
17:22
make the sun rise."
17:24
I'm like, "He makes the sun rise? What about God?"
17:27
God like, "Bitch, I make the sun rise."
17:31
She's crying and crying.
17:33
And I hear behind me, "Psst, psst, psst."
17:36
And I turn around like, "Oh, my God.
17:38
Somebody's trying to stop this ugly ass wedding. What?"
17:41
And it's her mother behind me going, "Psst, psst, psst.
17:45
Get her tissues. Get her tissues."
17:54
Bitch, this ain't "The Help 2."
17:55
I ain't getting her shit.
17:57
What?
18:02
I said, "I don't have any t-- I don't have any tissues."
18:06
"You're the maid of honor.
18:09
You're supposed to have tissues."
18:14
I was like, "I was at rehearsal with her for six hours.
18:18
She didn't do any of this shit.
18:21
I don't have tissues!"
18:23
Right? Do it in the dress rehearsal, bitch! I didn't know.
18:26
Cry.
18:33
We get to the reception.
18:35
They go to throw the bouquet.
18:39
I'm the only one in here, you know.
18:44
Me and three seven-year-olds,
18:49
and I'm looking at them like,
18:50
"Uh, get the hell outta here.
18:53
Your seven-year-old ass. I worked to be here."
18:59
She didn't even throw it.
19:02
She just called me up...
19:11
and she handed it to me.
19:14
And then a prayer circle formed around me.
19:27
Here's what I'll tell you.
19:30
I'm so honored to be a comic.
19:33
I am.
19:34
( cheers, applause )
19:40
I like to make people laugh. Understand, when we get up here
19:43
and we do comedy, it's 'cause we're all broken.
19:45
We are. No, no, no.
19:47
It looks good, but we're all depressed. We're crazy.
19:51
Sometimes suicidal. I would have killed myself, but I'm too fat
19:53
to die. Yeah, maybe if I was smaller, a paper cut, I'd
19:57
be outta here. Y'all can't get y'all hands cut, okay?
19:59
Y'all gonna die.
20:02
But I'm a big bitch.
20:04
I've thought about it. I tried it one time, you know?
20:06
Tried to get out of here.
20:08
Took some sleeping pills.
20:11
But then I just woke up two days later very rested, so...
20:15
You guys have been amazing. Thank you so much.
20:19
