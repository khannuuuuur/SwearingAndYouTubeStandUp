3:51
WHO'S GONNA FIGHT A GUY WITH A LUMP OF CRAP IN HIS HAND?
3:54

5:53
LIKE MY MOM'S BEEN LIVING IN THIS COUNTRY FOR 36 YEARS,
5:56
SHE STILL CAN'T GET HER P'S AND HER F'S RIGHT TO SAVE HER LIFE.
5:59
SHE CAN SAY 'EM JUST AT THE WRONG TIME.
6:01
LIKE GROWING UP SHE'D BE LIKE, "JOSEP?

6:30
YOU HEAR THAT ALL YOUR LIFE. YOU'RE LIKE,
6:32
"WHAT THE [BLEEP] ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?"
6:35
[LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE]
6:40
MY MOM WOULD PUT ME IN TALENT SHOWS.

THAT'S WHY I'M DOING THIS STUFF. YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN.
6:44
SHE PUT ME IN TALENT-- IT WAS THE WORST, MAN.
6:46
SHE ALWAYS PUT ME IN TALENT SHOWS
6:48
'CAUSE EVERYONE IN MY FAMILY SANG.
6:50
I HAD AN UNCLE THAT SANG. EVERYBODY SANG.
6:51
THEN MY MOM WOULD PUT MY SISTER AND I IN THESE TALENT SHOWS.
6:54
MY SISTER CAN SING. ME, I CAN'T DO ANYTHING.
6:57
I WOULD JUST BE BEHIND HER DOING THE ROBOT.
7:03
MY MOM WOULD BE LIKE, "BREAK DOWN, JOSEP."

"WELL, IT'S JUST THAT EVERYBODY IN THE FAMILY HAS TALENT;
7:30
"AH, YOUR UNCLE, HE HAS TALENT, AH, YOUR SISTER HAS A TALENT,
7:36
"AH, BUT YOU-- YOU DON'T...
7:38
[LAUGHTER]
7:40
YOU DON'T HAVE ANY TAL-- "YOU JUST DO THE...
7:44
"WHAT IS THAT? I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT THAT IS, JOSEP.
7:48
YOU JUST KEEP BREAKING DOWN. I DON'T--"
7:51
[LAUGHTER]
7:54
AND I WAS LIKE 13, YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN, AND AH--
7:56
THIS IS WHEN MY MOM FOUND OUT I HAD SOME KIND OF TALENT.
7:59
LIKE I WAS TAKING A SHOWER, OKAY, AND WHEN YOU'RE 13
8:01
YOU DON'T REALLY TAKE A SHOWER, YOU KIND OF LIKE--
8:04
I MEAN, YOU'RE WASHING STUFF, BUT IT'S USUALLY LIKE
8:07

8:10
I MEAN, WHEN YOU'RE 13, THAT IS ALL YOU WASH FOR ABOUT
8:13

8:18
AND MY MOM'S LIKE, "WOW, "HE HAS BEEN IN THERE FOR A LONG TIME.
8:22
- "I HOPE HE'S OKAY. - [LAUGHTER]
8:27
"MAYBE I SHOULD CHECK ON HIM,
8:31
SEE IF HE'S HURT OR SOMETHING."
8:34
AND SHE OPENS THE DOOR AND CATCHES ME GOING AT IT.
8:38
AND SHE'S LIKE, "OH MY GOD, JOSEP!
8:41
"VUT DOWN YOUR VENUS!
8:44
"VUT IT DOWN! YOU'RE GOING TO GO BLIND!"
8:49
SO, I'M 13 AND I DIDN'T WANT TO GET CAUGHT,
8:52
SO I HAD TO PLAY IT OFF. LIKE WHEN I WAS A KID
8:55
MICHAEL JACKSON WAS LIKE THE BIG THING.
8:57
LIKE EVERYONE WAS DANCING LIKE-- AND I WAS LIKE, "NO,
9:00

9:07
AND MY MOM WAS LIKE, "OH MY GOD, THAT'S TALENT."
9:11
[LAUGHTER, CHEERS, WHISTLES AND APPLAUSE]
9:18
I GUESS I KNOW WHERE MY MOM'S COMING FROM,
9:21
'CAUSE I'VE GOT A THREE YEAR OLD SON.
9:24
IT'S LIKE LIVING WITH A CRAZY MIDGET.
9:27

[LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE]
10:14
[CHEERS AND WHISTLES]
10:19
I'M LIKE, "WHERE THE HELL IS HIS HELMET?"
10:22
IT'S CRAZY. IF YOU GOT A THREE YEAR-OLD, GET 'EM BACK.
10:26
ALL RIGHT, I CAN'T WAIT FOR MY SON TO TURN 16.

10:43
HIS FRIENDS ARE GONNA BE LIKE,
10:45
"WHAT THE HELL'S WRONG WITH YOUR DAD?
10:48

10:52
GIRLS ARE SMARTER THAN BOYS BY THE WAY,
10:55
- YOU KNOW THAT, RIGHT? - [WOMEN CHEERING & APPLAUDING]
10:58
IT'S A PROVEN FACT; GIRLS ARE SMARTER THAN BOYS, THE REASON WHY IS,
11:01
I GOT A FRIEND THAT HAD A DAUGHTER THE SAME TIME I DID
11:03
BUT SHE'S BEEN TALKING FOR TWO YEARS NOW,
11:05
ARTICULATE, TOO. LIKE, "MOMMY, CAN I HAVE A SAND-WICH."

12:05
GUESS WHAT HE PLAYS WITH THE MOST? HIS PENIS,
12:09
HE CAN'T STOP PLAYING WITH HIS PENIS. IT'S THE BEST THOUGH.
12:12
HE CAN'T WAIT. AND HE PULLS IT OUT AND SAYS, "DADDY, LOOK AT MY TING TING."
12:16
HE CAN'T TALK BUT HE NAMED IT HIS "TING TING."
12:19
"DADDY." "WHAT?" "TING TING, DADDY! DADDY."

GUESS WHAT HE CALLS IT, "PUSHY."
12:41
"PUSHY, PUSHY, PUSHY, PUSHY, DADDY, I WANT PUSHY."
12:44
AND I KNOW YOU GUYS ARE THINKING TO YOURSELF,

12:53
WHILE HE'S TUGGING ON HIS TING TING...
12:55
[LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE]
13:01
TRY EXPLAINING THAT TO SECURITY FOR A HALF-HOUR.
13:06
WHEN YOU HAVE A KID, YOU REALIZE THAT WOMEN
13:09

13:24
YOU THINK YOU'RE TOUGH 'CAUSE YOU CATCH A FOOTBALL?
13:26
