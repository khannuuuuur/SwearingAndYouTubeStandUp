[audience laughing]
3:12
WHENEVER I TELL PEOPLE THAT,
3:13
THEY ALWAYS SAY THE SAME THING.
3:14
"BUT, MICHAEL, WE DON'T RECOGNIZE YOU.
3:16
"WE DON'T RECOGNIZE YOU IF YOU'RE A PRO-ATHLETE."
3:17
YOU KNOW WHAT I SAY TO THAT?
3:19
"OH, YEAH, NEW YORK, DO YOU RECOGNIZE ME NOW?
3:21

MY MOTHER'S A FORMER EIGHTH GRADE ENGLISH TEACHER

4:03
DON'T BE SO JUDGMENTAL, MOTHERS.
4:04
JUST LOVE YOUR CHILD, OKAY?
4:06
JUST GIVE 'EM A LITTLE HUG.
4:07
SHE CAME TO MY SHOW RECENTLY AND I TOLD A VERY DIRTY JOKE.
4:10
THAT'S WHAT I DID.
4:12
AND THE JOKE STARTED LIKE THIS.
4:13
I SAID, "RECENTLY, "ME AND MY GIRLFRIEND
4:16
"WERE [deleted] DOGGY STYLE."
4:18
THAT'S HOW THAT JOKE STARTS
4:19
AND IT GET A LOT MORE DIRTY AFTER THAT.
4:21
BUT I'M NOT GONNA DO IT.
4:22
AFTER THE SHOW, MY MOTHER COMES UP,
4:23
SHE IS ANGRY, DISTRAUGHT, EMBARRASSED,
4:27
A SINGLE TEAR'S COMING DOWN HER FACE.
4:29
SHE LOOKS ME IN THE EYE AND SHE SAYS,
4:30
"MICHAEL, THAT SHOULD BE MY GIRLFRIEND AND I."
4:35
[audience laughing]
4:37
[applause]
4:46
I'M THE YOUNGEST IN MY FAMILY.
4:47
MOST COMEDIANS ARE THE YOUNGEST IN THEIR FAMILY.
4:49
IT'S AN ATTENTION THING.
4:50
THE YOUNGEST CHILD NEEDS THE MOST ATTENTION.
4:52
THINK ABOUT YOUR OWN FAMILIES, OKAY?
4:54
WHY IS THAT?
4:56
I'LL TELL YOU WHY-- BECAUSE MOM AND DAD
4:57
NEVER PLANNED ON HAVING THEIR YOUNGEST CHILD, THAT'S WHY.
5:00
[audience laughing]
5:01
MOM GOT DRUNK ON NEW YEARS EVE
5:02
AND DAD TOOK HER TO POUND TOWN.
5:04
THAT'S HOW THE YOUNGEST CHILD HAPPENS,
5:06
AND I HATE SAYING THAT.
5:08
AND I LOOK AT PARENTS AND THEY NOD OR THEY CLAP.
5:10
THAT MAKES ME FEEL LIKE [deleted] ABOUT MYSELF, OKAY?
5:13
CLAP YOUR HANDS IF YOUR THE YOUNGEST IN YOUR FAMILY.
5:16
WHERE ARE THE YOUNGEST IN THE FAMILIES?
5:17
I LOVE YOU... I SUPPORT YOU... I LOVE YOU...
5:21
I'M SORRY I MADE FUN OF YOU EARLIER.
5:23
I SUPPORT YOU--
5:24
WE GOTTA STICK TOGETHER-- WHERE ARE THE OLDEST?
5:28
CLAP YOUR HANDS IF YOU'RE THE OLDEST IN YOUR FAMILY.
5:30
YEAH-- THIS GUY, YEP, COURSE-- NOT SURPRISED-- YEP.
5:35
YOU DON'T KNOW THIS, OLDEST-- THERE'S A UNIVERSAL NICKNAME
5:39
THAT THE YOUNGEST CALLS THE OLDEST.
5:41
WE CALL YOU GUYS "ASS [deleted]."
5:43
YOU'RE AN ASS [deleted], SIR.
5:45
YOU ARE AN ASS [deleted]-- SO ARE YOU.
5:47
YOU'RE A DICK HEAD.
5:51
- IN MY FAMILY IT GOES LIKE THIS:
5:52
JOHN, CHRISTY, TODD, MICHAEL.
5:54
OKAY, THAT'S MY NAME, MICHAEL.
5:56
EVERYONE HAS A FRIEND NAMED "MICHAEL."
5:59
EVERYONE CAN PRONOUNCE THE NAME "MICHAEL."
6:01
IT'S NOT A DIFFICULT NAME TO SAY, "MICHAEL."
6:04
WHEN I WAS BORN, MY BROTHER, TODD, WAS FOUR.
6:06
HE TRIED TO SAY MY NAME, MICHAEL.
6:08
BUT INSTEAD, HE SAID, "MIKEL."
6:11
"OH, ISN'T THAT SO CUTE-- "TODD SAID 'MIKEL.'"
6:13
SOMEHOW, "MIKEL" BECAME "PICKLE."
6:15
TO THIS DAY-- I AM 30 YEARS OLD--
6:18
MY ENTIRE FAMILY CALLS ME "PICKLE"
6:20
BECAUSE WHEN TODD WAS FOUR,
6:21
HE WAS [deleted] AND HE COULDN'T SAY "MICHAEL."
6:24
[audience laughing]
6:28
MI-CHAEL-- IT'S NOT HARD!
6:33
I'M IN MY DAD'S CELL PHONE AS "PICKLE"
6:36
BECAUSE TODD IS A [deleted] HEAD.
6:38
"'PICKLE,' DINNER'S READY"-- NO, MOM, IT'S MICHAEL, OKAY?
6:43
YOU AND DAD NAMED ME "MICHAEL."
6:44
I HAD MY BROTHER "TODDLES."
6:46
[audience laughing]
6:48
NOW WHENEVER TODD WAS BORED,
6:50
WHICH WAS EVERY DAY, 'CAUSE THAT'S ALL OLDER SIBLINGS ARE,
6:53
IS BORED, MISERABLE, ASS [deleted].
6:56
HE WOULD GRAB HIS FRIENDS AND THEY'D PLAY THIS GREAT GAME
7:00
WHERE THEY WOULD TAKE MICHAEL'S ARMS
7:03
AND THEY WOULD FORCEFULLY TIE HIM BEHIND A TREE TRUNK,
7:06
AND THEY WOULD TICKLE MY ARMPITS,
7:07
UNTIL I [deleted] MY PANTS.
7:10
[audience laughing]
7:17
THE GAME WOULD ACTUALLY END
7:18
WHEN THE TEARS WOULD HIT THE [deleted] IN MY PANTS.
7:22
"TICKLE THE PICKLE 'TIL HE [deleted]."
7:24
THEY HAD A NAME FOR THE GAME,
7:27
THAT'S HOW OFTEN THEY WERE PLAYING IT.
7:34
"TICKLE THE PICKLE 'TIL HE [deleted]," REALLY?
7:36
I'M A NINE YEAR OLD BOY, RIGHT?
7:39
I'M ADORABLE AT NINE.
7:40
LITTLE TINY-- LITTLE NINE YEAR OLD, LEATHER JACKET ON.
7:42
[audience laughing]
7:47
WHO ARE YOUR HEROES WHEN YOU'RE NINE?
7:48
YOUR OLDER BROTHERS, THAT'S WHO.
7:49
AND THEY TOOK ADVANTAGE OF THAT BIG TIME, JOHN AND TODD.
7:52
THEY USED TO PLAY "HIDE AND GO SEEK" WITH ME,
7:54
BUT THEY WOULDN'T GO SEEK.
7:56
[audience laughing]
7:58
WHO DOESN'T SEARCH FOR THEIR NINE-YEAR-OLD BROTHER?
8:02
THAT GAME'S CALLED "HIDE AND GO DIE," LITTLE BROTHER.
8:04
THAT'S WHAT THAT GAME'S CALLED.
8:06
[audience laughing]
8:07
OKAY, PICKLE, HERE'S HOW WE PLAY.
8:10
YOU GO FIND A REAL TIGHT SPACE WITH LIMITED OXYGEN.
8:13
WE'RE GONNA GO PLAY "LEGENDS OF ZELDA"
8:16
FOR SIX AND A HALF STRAIGHT DAYS.
8:21
HIDING IN MY NEIGHBOR'S CAR TRUNK,
8:22
"THEY'RE NEVER GONNA FIND ME HERE."
8:23
NO, THEY'RE NOT, 'CAUSE THEY'RE NOT LOOKING FOR YOU.
8:25
BECAUSE THEY'RE ASS [deleted].
8:27
[audience laughing]
8:29
I CAN'T EVEN TALK ABOUT IT.
8:30
I GET PISSED TALKING ABOUT MY OWN FAMILY.
8:31

11:17
I'M FROM MICHIGAN.
11:18
I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE HELL THAT MEANT.
11:20

11:21
APPARENTLY, BEING A VEGAN MEANS
11:22
YOU DON'T EAT ANYTHING AT A RESTAURANT
11:24
OR ON A MENU OR THAT'S CONVENIENT.
11:26
[audience laughing]
11:30

EVERYBODY KNOWS THAT!
14:21
CROCODILES ATTACK QUICKLY.
14:23
THEY DON'T CHANGE DIRECTIONS QUICKLY.
14:25
IT'S NOT JUST JOKES ALL THE TIME UP HERE.
14:29
[audience laughing]
14:31

BUT A TV AUDIENCE IS RIGHT THERE WITH YA.
14:51
THAT'S TOUGH, RIGHT?
14:53
FOUND HER ON FACEBOOK.
14:55
ISN'T THAT TOUGH FINDING YOUR EX ON FACEBOOK?

I TOLD HER, THOUGH, WHEN SHE BROKE UP WITH ME,
14:58
I SAID, "LOOK, I WILL FIND YOU.
15:01
[audience laughing]
15:03
"I WILL TRACK YOU DOWN."
15:06
EIGHT HUNDRED TWELVE PHOTOS ON MY EX'S FACE--
15:08
THAT'S A LOT OF PHOTOS OF AN EX.
15:10
THAT'S TOUGH-- THAT'S TOUGH TO SEE THAT.
15:12
I COMMENTED ON EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THOSE PHOTOS.
15:15
"REMEMBER US, "REMEMBER US?
15:21
"I TOLD YOU I'D FIND YA."
15:25
SHE HAD HER WEDDING ALBUM UP THERE-- YIKES!
15:27
MIGHT AS WELL RIP MY HEART OUT RIGHT IN FRONT OF ME.
15:29
I WENT TO THE FIRST PHOTO OF HER AND HER NEW HUSBAND
15:32
AND I WROTE, "I WAS THERE FIRST."
15:33
THAT'S WHAT I WROTE-- I DON'T CARE-- YEAH.
15:36
[audience laughing]
15:38

WENT ON A DATE RECENTLY WITH A WOMAN IN A WHEELCHAIR,
15:45
AND, UH... I STOOD HER UP.
