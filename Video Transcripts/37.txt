WHEN I MOVED TO NEW YORK, THOUGH--
1:17
IT'S FUNNY-- IT'S LIKE NEW YORK ACTS
1:18
LIKE IT'S A BIG MELTING POT,
1:20
'CAUSE IT'S LIKE ALL THE DIFFERENT CULTURES.
1:21
"OH, WE ALL MELT TOGETHER" AND EVERYTHING.
1:23
AND THEN, YOU MOVE HERE AND YOU REALIZE,
1:25
IT'S NOT A MELTING POT AT ALL.
1:26
IT'S ACTUALLY A BUNCH OF POTS
1:28
THAT WANNA LIVE NEXT TO THEIR OWN KINDS OF POTS,
1:29
AND NOT TALK TO OTHER POTS.
1:32
[audience laughing]
1:34

'CAUSE SHE'LL-- SHE ONLY HIRED LIKE OLD CHINESE DUDES
1:53
TO FIX HER STUFF.
1:54
SO, LIKE, WHEN THEY COME OVER,
1:56
THEY DON'T SPEAK ENGLISH,
1:57
AND, LIKE, I'M NOT GONNA LEARN ANOTHER LANGUAGE.
1:59
[audience laughing]
2:01
UH, I HAVE BARELY KNOCKED THIS ONE OUT.
2:03
SO... SO WHEN HE FIXES STUFF,
2:06
YOU JUST HOPE HE DOES THE RIGHT THING, YOU KNOW,
2:08
'CAUSE YOU CAN'T TELL HIM NOT--
2:10
IF HE COMES OVER AND STARTS FIXING THE COUCH,
2:11
YOU'RE LIKE, "ALL RIGHT.
2:12
"I GUESS THAT'S WHAT HE'S FIXING TODAY.
2:14
"I DON'T KNOW WHY WE WOULD ASK HIM TO DO THAT, BUT."
2:19
ONE DAY, HE CAME OVER AND OUR GAS HEAT BROKE,
2:21
SO HE COMES OVER TO FIX IT,
2:22
AND I'M STANDING OUTSIDE AND I SEE HIM,
2:24
LIKE, HE'S LIKE DOWNSTAIRS
2:25
AND YOU SEE LIKE A FIREBALL JUST EXPLODE, LIKE AT HIM.
2:29
SO, LIKE, HE, LIKE, LIGHTS IT-- HE RUNS OUTSIDE
2:31
AND YOU GET, LIKE-- WE'RE BOTH STANDING THERE
2:34

WE'RE JUST, LIKE [indistinct√ë.
2:40
[audience laughing]
2:45
"THAT'S ALL I GOT.
2:47
"I GOT NOTHIN', NOTHIN'."
2:49
[applause]
2:54
I MISS THE SOUTH-- I MISS GOIN' DOWN THERE.
2:57
LIKE, I MISS BEING ABLE TO GO TO WALMART VERY EASILY.
3:00
I'M A WALMART GUY-- I LIKE 'EM.
3:03
A LOT OF PEOPLE DON'T LIKE WALMART.
3:05
THEY SAY IT'S BIG BUSINESS,
3:06
LIKE IT KILLS THE MOM AND POP SHOPS.
3:08
BUT, REALLY WALMART,
3:10
THEY WERE A MOM AND POP SHOP, AT SOME POINT,
3:12
AND THEN THEY GOT THEIR ACT TOGETHER,
3:14
AND BECAME UNBELIEVABLE.
3:16
SO, YEAH, I JUST STUCK WITH THEM.
3:19
THEY'RE ALWAYS OPEN.
3:20
MOM AND POP SHOPS CLOSE FOR NO REASON.
3:22
YOU GO IN THERE-- YOU'RE LIKE,

"WHY ARE YOU CLOSED TODAY?"
3:25
THEY'RE LIKE, "WE'RE SAD."
3:26
YOU'RE LIKE, "ALL RIGHT.
3:28
"THAT'S NOT EVEN-- THAT'S NOT EVEN A LEGIT, LEGIT THING."
3:30
WALMART, YOU COULD SHOOT THE ENTIRE STAFF,
3:32
IT WOULD BE AN HOUR OF CONFUSION
3:34
AND THEY'D BE UP AND RUNNING AGAIN.
3:35
THAT'S HOW GREAT WALMART IS.
3:38
IT'S UNBELIEVABLE.
3:39
THE BEST.
3:41
[applause]
3:43
WENT TO SCHOOL IN TENNESSEE, WHICH IS FUN.
3:46
I WENT-I WENT TO A COMMUNITY COLLEGE FOR AN ENTIRE YEAR,
3:51
AND I DO NOT HAVE ONE CREDIT.
3:53
[audience laughing]
3:55
NONE OF IT COUNTED.
4:00
THE REASON IS 'CAUSE I HAD TO TAKE REMEDIAL CLASSES.
4:03
SO, WHICH "REMEDIAL" BASICALLY MEANS--
4:06
THEY'RE LIKE, "LOOK, WE HAVE NO IDEA
4:08
"HOW YOUR HIGH SCHOOL LET YOU LEAVE.
4:10
"AND WE ARE SHOCKED AND WE'RE ACTUALLY GONNA LOOK INTO IT.
4:14
[audience laughing]
4:16
"BUT... BUT UNTIL THEN,
4:18
"HERE'S YOUR CLASSES YOU'RE GONNA TAKE."
4:20
HERE'S WHAT I TOOK:
4:21
I TOOK MATH, LIKE, LIKE I DON'T--
4:23
LIKE THE BOOK SAID "MATH."
4:24
[audience laughing]
4:26
LIKE THAT'S WHAT-- HOW CRAZY IS THAT?
4:32
THEY STOPPED CALLING IT "MATH" AFTER LIKE SIXTH GRADE.
4:37
I-I HAD TO TAKE "READING"-- I TOOK "READING."
4:40
I DROVE TO THAT CLASS-- I DROVE TO A "READING" CLASS.
4:44
I'M NOT EVEN AN IMMIGRANT-- I AM FROM HERE.
4:46
I SHOULD HAVE KNOCKED THAT OUT YEARS AGO.
4:49
AND WITH "READING" I THINK THEY WERE JUST IMPRESSED
4:50
WHEN YOU MADE IT TO THE CLASS.
4:52
"LOOK WHO MADE IT TODAY, BUDDY."
4:53
YOU'RE LIKE, "FUN, GUYS-- YOU GUYS ARE GOOD-- THE BEST."
5:01
AND OH, IT SHOT DOWN MY DREAM
5:03
'CAUSE I WANTED TO PLAY COLLEGE BASKETBALL
5:06
AND... THAT... THAT DIDN'T WORK OUT.
5:12
IT DIDN'T WORK OUT 'CAUSE I GOT CUT EVERY YEAR
5:13
FROM MY HIGH SCHOOL BASKETBALL TEAM,
5:16
SO I HAD TO PLAY FOR MY CHURCH
5:18
BECAUSE-- YEAH, THE CHURCH CANNOT CUT YOU.
5:22
THEY HAVE TO LET YOU PLAY, WHICH IS NICE.
5:25
[audience laughing]
5:26
THAT'S A GOOD, YOU KNOW, THAT WOULD BE--
5:27
I GUESS THEY COULD CUT YOU-- YOU'D BE PRETTY BAD IF--
5:29
LIKE, "LOOK, WE THINK YOU'RE GOOD,
5:31
"BUT JESUS DOES NOT THINK YOU'RE THAT GOOD.
5:33
"YEAH, HE IS OUR CAPTAIN, SO."
5:37
[applause]
5:40
AND CHURCH BALL WAS A LOT DIFFERENT, TOO,
5:42
'CAUSE WE PLAYED-- IT WAS A HALF COURT,
5:44
NO THREE POINT LINE-- WE PLAYED ON CARPET.
5:48
THAT'S YOUR FIRST SIGN IT'S NOT GONNA COUNT.
5:51
AND THEY DIDN'T GIVE US A BASKETBALL.
5:53
WE DIDN'T HAVE A BALL.
5:55
LIKE, WE WOULD JUST STAND OUT THERE AND PLAY ON HONESTY.
5:58
SO, YOU'D BE LIKE, "I JUST MADE IT."
6:00
HE'S LIKE, "OH, THAT WAS A GOOD SHOT!
6:01
"YOU'RE REALLY GOOD."
6:03
"I STOLE IT."
6:04
"I FORGIVE YOU FOR STEALING IT."
6:05
IT WAS MORAL POINTS-- IT COUNTS LATER.
6:09
[audience laughing]
6:13
- YOU HAVE TO BE CAREFUL-- I DO.
6:14
YEAH, I JUST READ, ABOUT, UH,
6:15
THERE'S THIS NEW DEVISE YOU CAN BUY FOR YOUR CAR
6:18
AND IT'S GOT, IT'S LIKE A KEYLESS DEVISE
6:21
AND YOU PRESS, IT'S GOT A HEARTBEAT DETECTOR ON IT,
6:23
SO YOU AIM IT AT YOUR CAR, YOU PRESS IT.
6:26
IF IT FLASHES, THAT MEANS, LIKE, SOMEONE IS IN YOUR CAR
6:30
AND THEY'RE GONNA KILL YOU, ALL RIGHT?
6:32
[audience laughing]
6:33
IT'S NOT GONNA BE GOOD-- SO, YOU PRESS IT.
6:36
IF YOU WANNA BUY IT, IT'S LIKE $550 BUCKS.
6:38
IF YOU DO NOT HAVE THAT MONEY,
6:40
YOU CAN DO THE OLD-SCHOOL ROUTE
6:42
WHICH IS JUST LOOK IN THE WINDOW.
6:43
THAT-- IT'S EITHER WAY, REALLY, IT'S UP TO YOU.
6:49
I TOLD ONE GUY THAT HE TRIED TO TELL ME
6:51
IT WAS FOR LIKE WHEN PEOPLE LEAVE THEIR BABIES IN THEIR CAR.
6:53
LIKE, YOU KNOW, LIKE WHEN YOU GO OUT
6:56
AND YOU'RE LIKE, "I CANNOT REMEMBER
6:58
"IF I BROUGHT MY BABY TODAY.
7:00
[audience laughing]
7:02
"AND... I DON'T WANNA WALK ALL THE WAY BACK AND CHECK.
7:06
"LIKE, WHAT IF IT'S NOT THERE?
7:08
"IF IT'S NOT THERE, I'M GONNA LOOK LIKE A JACK ASS
7:09
"IN FRONT OF MY FRIENDS."
7:11
"I WISH I COULD CHECK SECRETLY
7:12
"WITHOUT EVERYBODY KNOWING."
7:19
HERE'S MY METHOD FOR IF SOMEONE'S GONNA HIDE IN MY CAR,
7:22
AND THEY'RE GONNA KILL ME-- IT'S A HUGE FEAR OF MINE.
7:24
SO, WHAT I DO IS, UH, RIGHT WHEN I START MY CAR,
7:28
I HAVE JOURNEY, "DON'T STOP BELIEVING" IN MY CD PLAYER.
7:32
SO RIGHT WHEN I START IT,
7:33
IT'S RIGHT ON THE "DON'T STOP BELIEVING" PART,
7:35
'CAUSE IT'S A GREAT SONG.
7:37
LIKE YOU COULDN'T COMMIT A MURDER TO THAT SONG.
7:39
THAT IS THAT GOOD OF A SONG.
7:41
THAT GUY WOULD WANT TO AND THEN HE WOULD LIKE JUST BE FURIOUS.
7:44
HE'S JUST GET UP AND BE LIKE,
7:45
"LOOK, THAT'S A, THAT'S A REALLY GOOD TUNE.
7:46
"ALL RIGHT-- YOU GOT ME."
7:47
AND THEN HE'D CLIMB UP FRONT WITH YOU
7:49
AND YOU'D BECOME FRIENDS.
7:50
AND THAT-THAT'S JUST A NEAT STORY.
7:53
LIKE, "HOW DO YOU KNOW DENNIS?"
7:55
"DENNIS, HE WAS A MURDERER.
7:56
"TURNS OUT PRETTY BIG 'JOURNEY' FAN.
7:59
"ACTUALLY, A GOOD GUY, ONCE YOU GET TO KNOW HIM.
8:01
"HE'S GOOD, HE'S GOOD-- HE'S A GOOD GUY."
8:04
[applause]
8:06
SOMETIMES...
8:10
I GET TO TRAVEL A LOT WHICH IS FUN.
8:13
I GET TO GO-- LIKE I GET TO GO TO LIKE
8:15
DIFFERENT COUNTRIES AND I-I DON'T DESERVE TO GO.
8:18
LIKE, I DON'T KNOW WHERE THESE COUNTRIES ARE AT.
8:20
I JUST GO.
8:22
I DIDN'T LEARN ABOUT ANY OF THEM.
8:23
LIKE I LEARNED ABOUT TENNESSEE.
8:25
I LEARNED ABOUT THE STATES THAT TOUCHED US
8:26
IN CASE THEY ATTACKED.
8:27
[audience laughing]
8:29
AND, YEAH, AND I WAS TOLD THE REST WAS EUROPE
8:31
AND THAT'S WHERE ALL THE GAYS LIVES.
8:33
SO, I DIDN'T HAVE A PASSPORT-- YOU KNOW, I WAS YOUNG.
8:39
I GOTTA GO TO BAHRAIN WHICH WAS FUN.
8:42
SOMEONE'S FROM BAHRAIN-- ARE YOU REALLY?
8:45
THAT'S CRAZY.
8:46
I-I HAD NO IDEA IT WAS A COUNTRY,
8:50
I'LL BE HONEST WITH YOU.
8:52
THREE YEARS AGO, I WOULD HAVE CALLED YOU A LIAR
8:54
'CAUSE YOU'RE FROM BAHRAIN.
8:55
[audience laughing]
8:57
I LITERALLY THOUGHT IT WAS THE GUY WE WERE MEETING.
8:59
LIKE THAT'S WHAT I JUST ASSUMED.
9:01
I JUST WALKED ABOUT BAHRAIN'S AIRPORT
9:03
LIKE, "HEY, DO YOU ALL KNOW THIS GUY, BAHRAIN?
9:05
"HE'S SUPPOSED TO MEET US HERE.
9:06
"IS HE SOMEWHERE NEAR HERE?"
9:08
[audience laughing]
9:11
WHEN WE WENT TO BAHRAIN, WE WERE DOING--
9:13
WE DID COMEDY FOR THE TROOPS
9:14
WHERE I DON'T HAVE, LIKE, A HUGE FOLLOWING IN BAHRAIN.
9:16
BUT I COULD START, THOUGH, WITH THE ONE GUY RIGHT HERE.
9:20
SO, IT'S ONE AT A TIME.
9:22
I-- SO WE GO OVER THERE AND WHEN YOU DO COME,
9:25
YOU STAY ON THE ARMY BASE,
9:27
BUT ON BAHRAIN, YOU COULD ACTUALLY LEAVE THE BASE
9:29
AND GO TO LIKE THE DOWNTOWN BAHRAIN, SO...
9:34
[audience laughing]
9:35
THEY TELL YOU WHEN YOU GO OUT THERE,
9:38
THEY'RE LIKE, "LOOK, IT'S SAFE
9:39
"JUST DON'T DRAW ATTENTION TO YOURSELF."
9:42
SO THEY'RE LIKE, "DON'T WEAR AMERICAN T-SHIRTS AND STUFF."
9:45
AND YOU'RE LIKE, "ALL RIGHT, THAT'S FAIR
9:46
"NO AMERICAN T-SHIRTS.
9:48
"SO WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO ABOUT THE WHITE ON MY SKIN?"
