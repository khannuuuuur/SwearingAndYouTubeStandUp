I'll do some impressions for you guys. Cleanse the palette.
0:02
Everyone likes impressions, you know? Okay.
0:04
This first impression...
0:06
is of Napoleon Bonaparte posing for his goofy portrait.
0:11
Okay, you've seen Napoleon in like a serious portrait
0:13
in history textbooks and museums.
0:14
Here's Napoleon posing for his goofy portrait.
0:22
- [audience laughing and applause]
0:30
- Okay, this next impression...
0:34
is of an extremely unprofessional doctor...
0:38
giving his patient the diagnosis.
0:39
So extremely unprofessional doc telling his patient what's up.
0:42
Here we go.
0:44
You sick fuck.
0:46
- [audience laughing]
0:57
- This next impression is of Jesus Christ...
1:01
at a wine bar.
1:03
"Uh, I'll just have a water."
1:04
- [audience laughing]
1:23
- You see a lot of pictures of babies online.
1:26
Especially when you search for them.
1:27
- [audience laughing]
1:30
- My friends just had a baby boy.
1:32
They put a picture of him on Facebook.
1:33
He's wearing a onesie. Cute little number.
1:36
Said, "Ladies, I have arrived."
1:40
I was like, "Okay, cool, this baby likes to fuck."
1:42
- [audience laughing]
1:48
- "That's a cool baby, yeah."
1:51
Take that baby out to the club.
1:54
That baby was born, he was like,
1:55
"Doc, whatever I came out of, I wanna get right back into.
1:58
You know what I mean?"
1:59
- [audience laughing]
2:07
- I like to do drugs, because they make me feel good.
2:11
One thing I like to do when I'm really bored
2:13
is I like to get really high.
2:15
And then I like to go to that Google maps.
2:18
And I go to the street view.
2:21
And I just drive.
2:23
- [audience laughing]
2:26
- [audience applause]
2:31
- See what's out there in that great big world of ours,
2:33
you know?
2:36
Put a little desk fan there, feel the wind in my hair.
2:39
- [audience laughing]
2:41
- Really live, you know?
2:44
I do smoke weed, but I don't wake and bake.
2:47
I woke and coke.
2:48
- [audience laughing]
2:55
- Really gets the 8Ball rolling, you know?
2:57
- [audience laughing]
2:59
- Do you guys know this? Back in the day,
3:01
they actually used to put cocaine in Coca-Cola?
3:06
Did you know you still can?
3:08
- [audience laughing]
3:11
- [audience applause]
3:16
- It's what you call a Coca-Cola Classic.
3:18
- [audience laughing]
3:24
- I like to have sex, because it makes me feel good.
3:26
I don't know if anyone here has ever had sex or cummed before,
3:29
but it's great.
3:30
- [audience laughing]
3:32
- Done most of the drugs, and cumming still.
3:34
It comes out on top.
3:35
- [audience laughing]
3:37
- A lot of times when it comes to sex,
3:39
you'll hear about a woman faking an orgasm.
3:41
Um, I've never experienced those.
3:44
- [audience laughing]
3:47
- But you never hear about a man faking his orgasm.
3:50
So, I'm just hear to say, no shame.
3:52
I'll admit it in front of all you fine folks tonight.
3:54
I have definitely faked an orgasm.
3:57
I was alone.
3:58
- [audience laughing]
4:04
- I was jerking off, I just wanted it to be over with,
4:06
you know what I mean? - [audience laughing]
4:08
- "Get out of my apartment, buddy, I got shit to do."
4:11
Ladies, you know what I'm talking about.
4:12
- [audience applause]
4:19
- Fellas--here's a head's up for the fellas.
4:21
For men, 80% of our sexual nerve endings
4:27
are actually in our butt.
4:31
Yeah.
4:32
Which just begs the question:
4:34
how do I get my butt inside a woman's vagina?
4:38
- [audience laughing]
4:46
- [audience applause]
4:52
- I don't know if you know this, but as you get older,
4:55
the taste buds on your tongue, they actually change with time.
4:59
Which I guess explains why now, as an adult,
5:03
I love eating that ass.
5:05
- [audience laughing]
5:15
- I hated it as a kid.
5:16
- [audience laughing]
5:27
- My mom was always like, "Two more bites."
5:28
- [audience laughing]
5:30
- "Ooh, he's a dirty boy."
