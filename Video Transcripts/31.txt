You get paid nothing for many, many years. Everything about it sucks. But every once in a while, you have an evening
0:16
that makes you do it for another ten years, and that's tonight's evening. Thank you very much. [jazzy music]

- Yeah! Yeah! Thank you.
1:06
Thank you, everybody. This is great. Michigan, we're in the house, huh? Come on! Come on!
1:12
Come on! Love Michigan. From Ann Arbor. You know, not too far away.
1:19
[cheers and applause] I live in New York now. They don't know what Michigan is.
1:24
I'll say, "Yeah, I'm from Michigan." And they'll go, "Oh, yeah, I have a, uh, cousin in Minneapolis."
1:30
And you go, "What? "You mean a 15-hour drive west
1:36
of where I said I'm from?" And they go, "Oh, yeah, my, uh, grandpa fishes in Montana." Are you just saying places
1:44
that start with the letter M? I grew up middle class.
1:51
Love middle class, you know? I'm wealthy now, but I was middle class then, you know?
2:00
We had everything we needed. We weren't rich. We weren't poor. One summer, I remember I couldn't go to soccer camp.
2:06
My dad said, "We don't have enough money to send you to soccer camp." So, I understand struggle, you know?
2:12
I-I-I understand sacrifice.
2:19
And then seven years ago, my dad retires. What? Excuse me? And he and my mom retire to New York City.
2:27
What? They got a three-bedroom condominium
2:32
in the Upper West Side of Manhattan. Excuse me? With a doorman. What?
2:39
First time I walked in their apartment, I said, "What the fuck is this? Huh?
2:44
"I can't go to soccer camp in 1996, and you got two guest bedrooms right now?"
2:57
So, I live with my parents. I did! I did! I did!
3:05
I was 38 years old. I got hired on "The Daily Show," and I was sleeping in a twin bed at my parents' house,
3:10
and it was nice. It's nice, dude, I'm telling you.
3:15
It's nice, dude! I'm telling you. 28 with your parents, something went wrong, you know,
3:21
but 38, it's nice, man, I'm telling you, it's nice. "Yeah, Mom, make coffee."
3:33
They're getting old now. When I was living with them before as a kid, you didn't know they were old, but now I'm like, "Holy shit,
3:38
that's a lot of vitamins on Dad's plate," you know? Dad loves vitamins. Your dad into vitamins?
3:44
My dad is into vitamins. He read a blog on vitamins four years ago,
3:50
and he is sticking with it, ladies and gentlemen. Any problem, vitamins will fix it.
3:57
My mom has been depressed. We don't know why. "Mom, why are you depressed?" "Michael, I'm 73. I can't move like I used to.
4:05
I lost two of my friends this year." Isn't that sad? Heartbreaking? Hearing your mom say that?
4:10
My dad, "Ah, she just needs more zinc." What?
4:16
Is--is that how zinc works, Dad? Is zinc gonna bring Mom's dead friends back to life?
4:22
This can't-- So, now I'm in New York, living in New York City.
4:29
Greatest city in the world. You know, that's what they scream at you right before they shove you down the subway stairs.
4:35
"Greatest city! Greatest city! Greatest!" Stab! Stab! Stab! Stab!
4:41
Greatest city! Stab! Stab! Stab! Stab! Greatest city in the world!
4:48
New York City is like the prettiest girl in the bar if she was like, "Hey, "prettiest girl's right fucking here! Prettiest girl! Prettiest girl's right here!"
4:55
Okay, okay, okay, okay. Yeah, okay, you're pretty, you're pretty. You know who's prettier?
5:02
The girl behind you who's shutting the fuck up for a second.
5:07
I think her name's Montreal? [chuckles]
5:12
You walk everywhere in New York. You guys don't walk anywhere here. Holy shit do you not walk anywhere.
5:17
You hate when you see somebody walking here. I was walking on the sidewalk. "Get him!" You guys drive your car up.
5:23
"What's he doing walking? "Get him! Hit him!
5:28
"Nobody walks! Detroit, Motor City! "Hit him! "No walking allowed here.
5:34
Don't even think about walking."
5:40
And you're always wet. I'm always wet every day in New York somehow.
5:47
Summer, it's humid. I'm walking. Ass, wet. Armpits, wet. Random air conditioners dripping on you.
5:52
Was that an air conditioner? I don't know, keep going. Wet, wet, wet. Fall, I put a jacket on, then the sun comes out.
5:59
Neck, wet. Head, wet. Backpack, wet. Winter, you put on all these clothes, right,
6:04
then you sit in the subway heat. Neck, wet. Hamstrings, wet. Feet, wet. Change my socks.
6:10
Feet, wet. Change my socks. Spring, raining, raining, wet. Bus, puddles, wet.
6:17
I'm always wet! Living in New York is like being Leonardo DiCaprio
6:25
in every single one of his movies. Let's go through 'em.
6:31
What do you wanna start with? "Titanic"? Drowns to death. Wet. "Great Gatsby." Dies in the pool at the end.
6:37
Wet. "Shutter Island." It's an island. Wet. "The Beach"? Wet.
6:45
Give me some. Give me some Leonardo movies. Give me some. - "Inception"! - "Inception," first dream, pouring rain--wet.
6:50
"Gangs of New York." He's in the whorehouse sweating the whole time. Wet. "Gilbert Grape." Takes a bath in the second act.
6:56
Wet. Give me some more! "Departed." Movie theater scene. Wearing a hat. Starts raining on him.
7:02
Wet. "Revenant." Starts in a fucking river. Wet! "Great Gatsby" I already said. It was the second example.
7:10
What's wrong with this audience? He dies in the pool at the end. Pay attention! Wet!
7:18
- "Blood Diamond." - "Blood Diamond." Runs into a river shooting a machine gun, wet. "Aviator." Crashes into the ocean: wet.
7:24
"Basketball Diaries." Top of the building jerking off. Starts raining on him. Wet.
7:31
He's always wet. He is always wet.
7:38
Tom Cruise, always running.
7:43
They should do a movie together called "He's Running, I'm Wet."
7:49
My point is that I hate New York. [hip-hop music]
7:55
♪ ♪
8:04
My point is that I hate New York.
8:10
It's the only city I've lived in where I see a pill on the sidewalk and I'll pick it up and swallow it.
8:16
I don't know what I'm gonna feel, but it's gotta be better than this shitty reality. What the fuck are we doing here?
8:24
Everybody hates it. Everybody hates living here.
8:29
But we lie, don't we? We say we love it to defend our rent and our life decisions.
8:35
"Oh, I love New York." Number one lie: "I love the energy.
8:42
I love the energy." It's not energy, you idiots. It's panic. It's desperation. It's poverty.
8:50
It's working three jobs and trying to not get hit by a bus every time you step outside.
8:56
"Oh, but it's the city that never sleeps." Yeah, and that does explain why everybody's such a fucking asshole all the time.
9:04
Maybe we should go to bed. Anybody ever think of that?
9:12
That should be New York's slogan. "Go to fucking bed, you guys. Jesus Christ."
9:18
Every day, every day...
9:23
I see grown men and women weeping in the streets.
9:31
Wet! Don't look at your phone when you're walking; look around.
9:37
You will see a grown man crying in the streets of Manhattan.
9:42
That's not the greatest city in the world. I've been a lot of places. People aren't crying in the streets
9:48
of Sydney, Australia, or Ann Arbor, Michigan, where I'm from. Yeah, you cry there, you cry there,
9:54
but you go home, don't you? You can't do that here. You got nine roommates in your one-bedroom apartment.
10:01
You can't cry in front of them every day. They'll call you a pussy every day. You can't even cry in the shower.
10:06
Two people are showering at the same time to save time and money and energy.
10:13
The only good thing about living in New York City is that once I got used to how expensive it was,
10:19
now when I go other places-- [blows raspberries] I feel like a Saudi prince, you know what I mean?
10:28
I was in Kansas City. I ordered two margaritas. The guy will be like, "That'll be 9.75." And I was like, "I want 500 margaritas!"
10:41
"I am the Saudi prince of Kansas City.
10:47
Give me my change. I wanna buy a lake house with it."
10:57
It's just hard. It's just hard. Even getting here was hard, wasn't it?
11:03
Something about it was hard. They made you wait out there. Oh, it was hard.
11:09
"I didn't know I was going to a special shooting." Hard. "Pretzels are $26?"
11:15
Hard, it's just hard. It's like we're living in a pinball game, right,
11:22
but the flippers are broken. And we keep launching balls, and we keep trying, trying, trying,
11:28
but no-- [whooshes] Dead! New ball! New ball! Try harder, try harder! [whooshes] Dead!
11:36
And then each new game is $6,000 a month.
11:41
And we keep playing. Why? Where I'm from in Michigan, life, it's easy, man.
11:47
It's pinball, but it's 100 balls, and it's 300 flippers, and they all work perfectly, right?
11:54
And, yeah, your wife's obese, but who cares?
12:04
They're great people, Michiganders. They're reliable. They're kind. They're sympathetic.
12:10
If they say they're going to show up to your birthday party, bang, they show up to your birthday party. And I say that in New York, and people laugh.
12:19
I didn't even say a joke. I just said that, where I'm from,
12:25
people do what they say they're going to do, and New Yorkers think that's a hilarious joke
12:31
told on a comedy stage. So I battle this. I try to be kind.
12:39
I try to be sympathetic and reliable. But I live somewhere where those characteristics
12:44
are not rewarded, are they? You need to be aggressive and direct and violent and strong.
12:51
Last week, I was trying to get on the subway, okay? Wednesday, 8:00 a.m. Excuse me, I was trying to get in line
12:58
to get in line to get in line to fight down a staircase to punch a family,
13:06
so I could get on the L train, okay? Wednesday, 8:30 a.m. No one's moving.
13:11
What's going on? What the fuck is going on right now? A thousand adults can't get down a staircase.
13:19
Why is nobody moving? And I look, and the front of the staircase,
13:25
there's a little girl holding birthday balloons. "Happy birthday to me.
13:32
I'm special." And she's walking down the steps real slow
13:38
and real wide. And I looked at her, and I took a deep breath.
13:44
And then I thought, "I don't give a fuck."
13:52
We gotta go, kid. There's 1,000 adults that gotta get to work,
13:57
pay their taxes, make this city move. We gotta go. We gotta go.
14:06
Then I Googled it. Seventeen million people have a birthday every day in the world.
14:11
Happy birthday, 17 million people. 800,000 Americans are having a birthday today.
14:18
Divide that in two by gender. 400,000 women in America are having a birthday today.
14:26
25% of the population is children. That means 100,000 little girls...
14:34
Are having a birthday today in the United States of America. Three percent of the U.S. population
14:41
lives here in New York City, so 3,000...
14:48
Little girls... are having a birthday today in New York City,
14:54
so you're not fucking special, are you, okay? You're not even close. You're not even--
14:59
You're one of 3,000 other little girls having a birthday in this city.
15:05
So we gotta go. We gotta move.
15:10
I can't be late and miss my guided meditation class.
15:17
It calms me down! I'm sad that the summer is over.
15:22
Man, it hits you hard. Doesn't go gracefully. Bang, zero degrees! Snow Monday.
15:28
Bang! Crash. Summertime, ah, hot girls everywhere, right?
15:35
Uh! How old are you, buddy? How old are you?
15:40
Nineteen. Young, man. Whole life right in front of you. What about you, guy? Yeah. Twenty-four.
15:46
What's your name, 24? Patrick. Yeah, stupid name.
15:52
When you're Patrick's age, you see a beautiful woman, you get excited, don't you? You comb your hair a little bit. "Oh, pretty girl over there." I'm 40.
15:59
Makes you mad, doesn't it, fellas? God damn it, that girl's hot over there! Fuck! Shit!
16:06
God damn it! You get mad at your own girlfriend.
16:11
"Hurry up back there! Jesus Christ!" [sighs]
16:19
That's power, ladies. You're so beautiful, you make us angry at people that we love.
16:25
That doesn't happen to women. Women don't see another handsome man and get mad at their man. No, because you love him
16:31
or something stupid like that, you know? And he sneezes, and snot comes out,
16:36
and you're like, "It's kinda cute when Peter sneezes and a little bit of snot comes out."
16:41
But when you sneeze and snot comes out, you know what Peter's thinking? "I bet that hot girl doesn't sneeze and snot comes out.
16:46
God damn it! Shit!"
16:52
And you know what you're doing, ladies. [blowing raspberries]
17:04
Wearing these outfits right here. In the summer, it's like a tank top, you know, and it's kinda loose on the side,
17:11
and we can look in the side. [laughs] You ever look in the side, Patrick? You know what I'm talking about?
17:17
You ever see a little side bra peeking out? Uh!
17:24
Side boob? You ever see side boob? [choral singing]
17:34
Side boob changes everything, doesn't it? Doesn't it? I tried it, right.
17:39
So, I cut a sliver out of my jeans just right here, so you can look in the side.
17:45
You can see a little side ball hanging out.
17:50
A little side dick. But side dick is gross, right? Side dick is gross.
17:56
Side dick is gross. Side boob is amazing. You see side boob, you hit your friend.
18:02
"Turn around, dude, side boob's here. Turn around! Turn around, side boob's here." But if you see side dick, "Oh, God, oh, shit!
18:09
"Ah! "Ah, I just saw side dick "at 24 Hour Fitness today.
18:17
Ugh." Why is it so different? Why is it so different?
18:24
Why is side dick so different from side boob? I'll tell you why. 'Cause everyone loves boobs. That's the difference.
18:31
Men love boobs, and women love boobs. Why? 'Cause we used to suck on boobs.
18:36
As babies, we sucked on boobs. And they gave us life.
18:42
We didn't suck on dicks. What?
18:48
We weren't babies sucking on Dad's dick. It's gross to even picture. Why are you picturing that?
18:54
But that's what we do with Mom. That's what we do with Mom.
19:01
There's no such thing as dick milk for babies.
19:15
Sadly, there's probably somebody here thinking, "Well, I had to suck on my dad's dick."
19:21
Well, you had a bad dad.
19:29
I never sucked on my dad's dick, not even once!
19:37
Where are you from, Patrick? South Lyon, sure.
19:42
Right underneath North Lyon. Don't have to tell me.
19:49
I still remember all the cities.
19:54
You've been a good audience member, Patrick; you are, man. He's 23--he's 24. 24, man.
20:00
Thank you--almost 24, so you are 23, so even I got your age correct before you did.
20:06
And we wonder why fucking China's winning.
20:12
Twenty-three--you're good, though, man, you are. You're paying attention. You're making eye contact. I appreciate that, you know.
20:18
Young people, I appreciate that. So many shows I do now-- [grunting, mumbling]
20:24
The only time you guys look up is to see if there's an outlet that you can plug your phone into and just...
20:30
You guys cross the street like this. Cars zooming by. I always give you a little nudge with my car.
20:37
"Oh, sorry, I didn't see you. I was texting also." [laughs]
20:44
You're soft, Patrick! Don't worry, he won't do shit.
20:50
[whispers] You're soft. We talk shit about millennials, you know? We say, "You're soft." 'Cause you are, you're pussies.
20:56
But... it's not your fault. It's not your fault!
21:02
We're hard on you, but it's not your fault. It's your parents' fault. It's Patrick's parents' fault. Helicopter parents--what did we expect was gonna happen?
21:08
"Don't do that, don't do that, don't do that, don't do that." Hand sanitizer, hand sanitizer. "Don't do that. I'll protect you. Don't do that. I'll protect you."
21:16
I didn't have that shit. Yeah, I live with my parents now, but I didn't have that as a kid.
21:24
When I was a kid, my brother Todd and I used to play baseball in our basement, but instead of using a baseball, we used these old metal darts
21:32
that I found next to the gasoline. [whooshes] And I'm just... [whooshes]
21:38
Whipping gasoline darts at my brother... [whooshes] For hours, unsupervised, dipping them in the gas.
21:46
And Todd liked to crowd the plate, so now I gotta throw high heat metal gas darts
21:51
past my brother's face. And one of them caught him late, stuck right in his eyeball, and I run upstairs,
21:57
"Dad, Dad, Dad, Todd has a fucking dart in his eye right now." You know what my dad says?
22:03
"Wake me if it becomes an emergency." That's what my dad says. That's not happening to Patrick, I bet.
22:08
Patrick's in the basement in South Lyon wearing a helmet and shoulder pads, you know. His dad's blowing him bubbles.
22:15
[whooshing] He's swinging and missing, but he still gets
22:20
a participation trophy at the end of it. You fucking loser, Patrick.
22:32
Yeah, my brother Todd, he's 43 now, 43. He just had a second baby. He's got this cute little boy named Winston,
22:38
and he's six months old, and he fits in my brother's arm. And I get all these pictures of Todd holding Winston,
22:44
and I zoom in. But I don't zoom in on the baby, no, no, no, no, no, no. I zoom in on my brother's face,
22:50
'cause guess what's still there after all these years? Todd's 35, and he's got a black mark on his eyelid,
22:57
and it twitches when it rains outside, and his little son looks up
23:02
and sees his dad's eyelid twitching, and he says, "That's right, don't crowd the plate when Uncle Michael's pitching."
23:13
Text neck. You know what text neck is, Patrick, huh? You don't even know what your fucking age is.
23:18
How are you gonna know what text neck is? Text neck is a real medical ailment
23:26
that millennials are getting. Scoliosis of the top of the spine.
23:31
And you're growing calcium deposits in the back of your skull to help bring your skull up.
23:37
See, this is the wrong show to make fun of young people at. I'm looking out, and you're all like, "Keep going, motherfucker.
23:44
"We're writing blogs about this joke right now. You're gonna be canceled in 35 minutes."
23:50
You're growing horns in the back of your head, Patrick.
23:57
I believe in evolution, okay? I believe in evolution. A lot of places I perform comedy don't.
24:04
But I believe in evolution. I believe we-- [laughs] Thank you.
24:10
Not every audience claps at that part. I believe we started on the ground 6 million years ago
24:17
as tadpoles, and there was turmoil and violence, time and pressure, and we advanced, and we became frogs,
24:24
and there was more turmoil, time, violence, and pressure, and we advanced, and we became bobcats or whatever's next,
24:31
I don't know. And this pattern kept repeating itself, and we kept evolving, and here we are today,
24:37
look, walking upright, straight spine, still evolving. Who knows what's next? Maybe we can fly someday.
24:43
But we'll never know, we'll we? Because Patrick and all of his friends are literally reversing evolution.
24:49
Patrick's like this. Patrick's first child is going to be like this. Patrick's grandchild is going to be like that.
24:57
His great-grandchild's going to be a bobcat. His great-grandchild is going to be a tadpole,
25:03
and then we're gone forever. We've ended civilization, and it's Patrick's fault.
25:12
Come on, Patrick! It's not so easy getting up.
25:19
Getting up is getting harder and harder. Not just getting up off the floor either.
25:26
You know what I'm talking about right here. Enjoy those erections, Patrick.
25:34
All of you, enjoy those erections. You think they're sticking around forever, but...
25:40
Don't get me wrong, I can still, but I'm not--I'm not packing the heat Patrick is right here,
25:46
I guarantee it. What do you do, Patrick? Student? Working? What do you do, buddy?
25:52
What do you do? - [inaudible] - Anesthesia tech ed. Seems like those are three different jobs.
25:59
Huh? - [inaudible] - Okay, so, anesthesia tech. So, the anesthesiologist puts anesthesia on the patient,
26:07
and then you tweet about it on your phone?
26:13
I'm envious of your generation. I'm envious. Am I worried that you're losing some toughness?
26:19
Yeah, I am. Am I losing toughness every year? Yeah, we all are. Think about the older gen-- think about my grandparents,
26:25
your grandparents. My grandma? Doris? [sighs] Tough.
26:31
Tough. She lived through the Great Depression. Do you know those people? They don't even speak...
26:41
'Cause they're conserving their words. They're called the Silent Generation.
26:49
The Silent Generation. They were tough, man. My grandma, we moved my grandma from one house to a smaller house,
26:54
and I was unpacking the box of kitchen stuff, okay, and there was a spool of tinfoil in there
27:00
that she had reused 55,000 times. My grandma bought tinfoil one time in 1931,
27:09
and that is it for the tinfoil! Meanwhile, I got boxes of tinfoil at my house. Sometimes I measure incorrectly.
27:15
I crumple it up, throw it in the ocean. I start over again.
27:21
And there was this little piece of tinfoil, triangular shaped, that she had folded over many, many times,
27:28
taped shut, packed... moved.
27:35
And I found this piece of tinfoil, and I took the tape off, and I peeled back the layers,
27:40
and inside was just a little piece of a chocolate chip cookie
27:46
that she packed and she moved from one home to a new home. Isn't that so sweet?
27:52
Isn't that so indicative of that generation? I mean, one time I moved, and my new stairs, they were steep.
27:59
They were steep, okay, so I threw my couch away.
28:06
We should just get a new couch. Those are steep stairs. Let's--let's just...
28:19
We're addicted to technology now. We are completely addicted. We rely on it.
28:26
It's making us dumb. It's smart. It's smart. Technology's never been smarter. Smart phone, smart computer, smart tablet,
28:34
smart car, smart water. Everything is smart. Except for who? Us.
28:39
We're dumb as shit. We've never been dumber in the history--
28:44
Have you spelled recently? Have you tried spelling without your phone?
28:51
Are the words harder? I was on an airplane doing a crossword.
28:57
I had to spell "silhouette." [blows raspberries] I don't know, "S"? Is it "S"?
29:04
Is it? Is it "S"? "Commitment"? Fourteen M's in a row.
29:09
I have--is it? Is it, is it not? "Diarrhea"?
29:15
I'd rather have it.
29:21
It's killing our brain. Think about how many phone numbers you knew as a child. Think about how many phone numbers you had memorized as a child.
29:27
I knew everyone's phone number. I'm 40 now. I know one phone number by heart. My phone number.
29:34
If I get arrested, and I can make one phone call, do you know what I can do? I can check my voice mail. That's what I can do.
29:42
I just have to hope somebody leaves me a message with their number in it. "In case you got arrested, call me back.
29:47
734-24--[...]"
29:52
I was reading a real book, and I tried to pinch-zoom the real book. Bigger!
30:03
We are addicted, it's making us dumb, and it doesn't even work. Does anything fucking work ever?
30:10
Do you like washing your hands now, huh? Motion sensor faucet? You like the motion--you like the motion sensor faucet?
30:19
Was that a good invention that moved humanity forward through technology?
30:24
The guy that invented the motion sensor faucet should be executed on live television
30:30
at halftime of the Super Bowl as a message to other inventors!
30:40
I'm at the Atlanta Airport last week. I'm like a bad DJ trying to get water out of the faucet. [grunting]
30:47
Soap, soap, s-soap, soap, soap. S-soap, soap, soap, s-soap, soap, soap, soap, soap, soap.
30:53
Paper towel, paper towel, paper towel, paper towel. Paper towel, paper towel, paper towel.
30:58
We're going to die of Zika, because we haven't properly washed our hands since 1982.
31:03
Nothing works. Nothing works!
31:12
Every hotel I stay in, my magnetic key loses power after three minutes.
31:20
And you gotta go down to the front desk, and you gotta wait in line, and when you finally get up there, she treats you like a piece of shit, doesn't she?
31:27
"Well, did it touch something magnetic?" "Huh?
31:33
Did you--did you have it touch something magnetic?"
31:38
"Yeah, Earth, bitch. It's all magnetic!" Everything is magnetic. Everything--that's magnetic, that's magnetic,
31:45
this is--everything's magnetic. Why would you make a key that can't touch magnets?
31:52
You know what keys could touch magnets? Old keys, the ones that went in the door and turned the deadbolt.
31:59
They could sit on magnets all day long. They could store on magnets if you wanted to. "Uh, well, did it touch your cell phone?
32:06
"Huh? Huh? Did you have it--did you have it touch your cell phone?" Yes. Yes, I did, yes, yes, yes.
32:14
Everything touches my cell phone. I drive with this thing lodged underneath my dick now, okay?
32:22
That's how much of an extension the phone has become of our body.
32:29
Let's make a key that can touch our cell phone, please.
32:42
Let me get this straight. I have a functioning magnetic hotel key, okay,
32:50
but if it gets close to the phone, that breaks the key?
32:57
But it's okay just to hold this up to our brain? That's okay? It's okay to push this into our brain!
33:05
We're going to die because of this. You know that? We're going to die because of this!
33:14
Tonight!
33:20
You laugh at these jokes, but nothing will change. They say comedy's powerful, but not powerful enough to get you off the cloud.
33:30
What are we doing on the cloud? Everybody, it's a failure. The cloud is a failure. Everybody's hacked.
33:37
"Hey, put all your pictures up there. "What could go wrong? "Hey, while we're up there,
33:43
"let's put all our financials up on the cloud and all our passwords." Everybody's hacked. Everybody.
33:49
Yahoo, hacked, 2 billion people. Apple, hacked. Home Depot, hacked. Hillary Clinton, hacked.
33:57
Democratic National Party, hacked. Capital One, hacked. Equifax, 800 million people, hacked.
34:03
British Airways, hacked. Justin Verlander, hacked. Ashley Madison. Ah! Hacked.
34:10
The fucking Pentagon's cloud got hacked. You think your Flickr account's safe?
34:19
This is the cloud. It's somewhere-- we don't know where it is-- that we store valuables that smarter people have access to.
34:27
Does that sound good? Do you guys like that? You guys wanna use the cloud?
34:34
I would rather store things in a real cloud.
34:41
You know what's worked for centuries? The ground. Get a shovel, dig a hole,
34:48
put your dick pics in the hole. Put dirt over your dick pics.
34:55
You would at least know if somebody was hacking your ground, right? "Honey, there's a man outside digging a hole in our lawn."
35:02
"Ah, fuck, we're being hacked again."
35:09
We're dumb now. We are dumb now. You don't believe me? We lock our car now, and as we walk away,
35:15
"Did I lock it? Did I lock it? "Did I lock it? Did we lock it?
35:21
"Did we lock it? Did we lock it? "Did I lock it? Did I lock it?
35:28
Did I lock it?" The third time you hit lock,
35:33
you should be electrocuted to death, and have to give your car to someone that can use their fucking brain
35:39
and remember if they locked it .25 seconds ago. Some of you aren't laughing.
35:45
You're the assholes I wake up to. Every city, "Did we lock it?" [honks] "Better be sure. Better be sure."
35:51
"Did we lock it?" [honking] Use your brain, everybody, okay?
36:02
Can I tell you a little secret? You know what happens if you don't lock it?
36:07
Nothing happens. Don't leave a bag of cash
36:14
sitting shotgun, and no one's going to break into your Kia Sorento...
36:19
Patrick. What a fucking loser Patrick is.
36:28
"Anesthesiology tech at Michigan."
36:38
Better hope I don't get, like, some meniscus tear in my knee ten years from now, and I'm laying on the operating table, and he's like, "Patrick here."
36:45
"Ah!" Fade to black. - ♪ In Detroit and L.A. ♪
36:52
♪ People stop and they say ♪ ♪ Michael Kosta is back in town ♪
36:59
♪ Michael Kosta is back in town ♪ ♪ ♪
37:09
- L.A. is so dumb. Dumb, you guys.
37:17
I was here the night Trump won, right. I was on Sunset Boulevard. Ah, it baffled me. People weeping.
37:24
[crying, panting] "I can't believe it.
37:31
I can't believe it." And I was looking around going, "You can't--
37:37
have you ever been anywhere else in the United States?"
37:44
"Have you ever been 30 miles east of here "or Ohio or Tennessee
37:51
"or an Applebee's? How--"
37:57
"How can you not believe it? I can't believe that you can't believe it."
38:04
Get some perspective, everybody. This is not even close to real America, okay?
38:10
All right? Look around, look around. You see how everybody's pretty good-looking? There's your first sign right there, okay?
38:23
People don't get new cars every six months in real America.
38:29
You get a new car 49 years after your first car, and that's because the engine flew out on a family vacation.
38:38
Smoothies aren't $11.85 for four ounces.
38:46
Nobody else in this country thought "Birdman" was a good movie. Do you guys know that?
38:52
Is that hard for some of you? Is that hard for some of you to hear that?
38:57
"Well, I'm the cinematographer"-- No, everybody hated "Birdman," dude.
39:05
Stop tweeting that you hate the president. "I hate the pres"-- every time you do that, my friends back home load their guns, okay?
39:13
They're dumb. Yes, you're right, they're dumb. They are dumb, and they're armed, aren't they?
39:22
And they're coming. They're moving west. What are we armed with here, what, avocado toasts?
39:31
What are you going to do, throw brunch at them? Shut the fuck up.
39:46
L.A. is its own little bubble and world. I have the worst agent. I have the worst fucking agent.
39:54
I'm sure he already left. Doesn't matter. I can do the joke. Dan Spector at WME Entertainment.
40:01
Do you know him? Dan Spector. His email is D--[bleep]-- at--[bleep]--dot com.
40:11
They called me, I answered. His assistant goes, "Can you hold for Dan?" I'm now on hold. They called me.
40:19
I'm holding. I'm holding. They called me. I'm holding.
40:24
I'm the one who's holding. They called me. I was available. Now I'm holding.
40:31
I'm the one who's on hold. Who's holding? I'm the one who's holding, okay?
40:37
And like an asshole, I held. And she comes back ten minutes later.
40:43
"Michael, who are you holding for?" "I'm holding for Dan." "I'm sorry, he's not available right now." "You fucking called me!"
40:54
So, last time I met with my agent, Dan Spector,
41:00
I took all his business cards, okay. He had, like, 180 business cards on his desk.
41:05
I took them all. Here's my favorite part about L.A.
41:11
Karaoke. People take it seriously here. They think it's an audition.
41:19
They think they're going to be discovered that night after that song.
41:25
Here's how people in real America do karaoke: You get blackout drunk, you sing your favorite Journey song,
41:31
and then you drive home as fast as you can, okay? That's how everyone else does karaoke in the United States.
41:39
But not in L.A. Choreographed dance moves, you know.
41:44
They pass out headshots afterwards. What?
41:50
So, I go to karaoke in L.A., and I put on my nicest suit,
41:56
and I bring my agent's business cards with me.
42:02
And after a really terrible but committed performance, I go up to that person and I say,
42:08
"You listen to me, god damn it, "I am a talent agent,
42:14
and I believe you are going to be a star," and then I slide them one of Dan Spector's business cards.
42:22
"You call me tomorrow, "and if I don't call you back, you call me 10,000 more times.
42:29
Stop by my office." And I circle the address. "Send me packages.
42:36
Show me you have what it takes." [chuckles]
42:44
Politics, look, it's not a straight line, okay? It's not in this country.
42:51
It's not the left over here versus the right over here. It's not. I perform everywhere in the United States.
42:56
It's more like a horseshoe. It's more like the shape of a horseshoe, okay? Most Americans are up here in the center.
43:03
Maybe you lean left a little bit. Maybe you lean right, okay? But all the fucking wackos,
43:08
they go to the edge-- [whooshes] And, look, they fall all the way down, don't they? And look, they're kinda close to each other.
43:17
Here's the guy that loves guns and God, and here's the woman that makes her own hemp sandals and honey.
43:26
And just let them kill each other, okay? Just keep it up here. You can lean left,
43:33
but you keep one leg in the center, all right? You can go to the right, but keep one leg in the center. Just do this.
43:39
Just do basketball defense drills.
43:45
People here are like, "But I do make my own honey."
43:54
[chuckles] [groans] I gotta wake up early. [groaning]
44:01
I was having fun, you know, and then it got in my head. I have a 5:00 a.m. flight in three weeks,
44:09
and I-I-I can't stop thinking about it. I mean, it gets in your head, doesn't it?
44:18
My friends wanted to get drunk tonight, and I was like, "I better not. I got this 5:00 a.m. flight in three weeks."
44:23
And I know it's coming, but you're never ready. You're never ready for a 5:00 a.m. flight.
44:30
I'll sleep, like, eight minutes, you know. I'll pack drunk. You ever pack drunk?
44:36
It's the best! 'Cause you land, and you see your bag, and you're like, what is in this bag?
44:45
What is this surprise box that I sent to myself
44:51
from the past? Oh, my God, I got nine T-shirts and a snorkel mask.
44:57
That's great. I'm in Kansas City in February.
45:03
One time I got so drunk in Phoenix, I packed, flew home, opened my suitcase. I had the hotel's TV remote control.
45:12
The grossest item in a hotel I packed drunk.
45:20
When you fly somewhere, you really think about packing, you know? You talk it out with each other.
45:26
"Do I need 12 belts?" You know. We stuff things in the shoes. That's a good spot.
45:32
We always weigh it. We don't know, but we're like, "Oh, yeah, that feels about right, uh-huh." But if you're driving somewhere...
45:41
"Bring it! "Bring it, we're driving. Bring it!"
45:48
"Honey, should I bring the blender?" "Yes.
45:53
"We're driving. I may wanna make fresh tomato soup this weekend."
45:58
"What about the treadmill?" "It's already packed. We're driving. We're driving!"
46:06
"2005 tax returns?" "Of course! "What if the accountant calls?
46:13
We're driving." Do you guys get it?
46:19
Or do you want more examples of stuff? More? Okay.
46:26
"Sophie's prom dress?" "Yeah! We're driving! "Who's Sophie?" "I don't know!
46:32
Pick her up! We're fucking driving!"
46:38
It's tough doing comedy. It's tough.
46:44
It's tough being a straight white male, man. It's tough. It's tough.
46:50
We had a good run. We had a good run, straight whites.
47:03
4,000 years is a pretty good run, I feel like, but, man, it is over for us this year.
47:09
So many unforced errors for the straight whites this year.
47:14
I can't even do what I love anymore, which is masturbate in front of women without their consent.
47:21
It's a witch hunt. You know it's a witch hunt.
47:27
It's tough being a great straight white.
47:33
They got Bill O'Reilly. They got Bill O'Reilly, Fox News commentator.
47:39
Women accused him of sexual harassment. He paid her $32 million. [whistling]
47:50
$32 mil. That is a lot of money. That is so much money that I Googled harassment, okay,
47:57
and you know what harassment is? It's hearing unwanted or lewd remarks.
48:05
$32 mil. Look, I live in New York City.
48:12
Where's my $32 million? A stranger threw a bag of shit at me
48:21
last month on the D train. I can't even get a free bus transfer?
48:28
All of you could jerk off on me for $32 million. I swear to God. I swear to God.
48:34
I don't want Comedy Central to cut that line. I swear to God, all of you could jerk off.
48:41
You can do it twice, buddy, all right? That's why you're sitting so high. I get it.
48:47
Look, I don't like Bill O'Reilly. Fuck that guy, okay? But that's a profitable accusation.
48:55
I always thought if I had a daughter, you know, I would teach her science or golf or something,
49:00
but now I think I'm gonna teach her how to flirt and take screenshots.
49:10
MeToo is a powerful movement, okay? It's tough to do jokes about it...
49:19
But here it goes. You can't even say MeToo. Guys freak out.
49:25
Stand up straight! Put your hands in your pockets! Look straight ahead! Close your eyes! Don't move your head! [indistinct]
49:31
I don't like saying the phrase. I don't even like saying the phrase. My friends are like, "You wanna go to the bar and get drunk?" "Yeah, me too. Ah, fuck, not that MeToo.
49:37
Uh, I will also, I will also, I will also." I support victims of sexual assault, obviously.
49:45
I support victims of sexual harassment, obviously. I don't know what sexual misconduct is.
49:51
What is sexual misconduct? Seems like every time I've had sex,
49:57
somebody is misconducting themselves a little bit, doesn't it? Doesn't it?
50:03
Don't you want a little misconduct? If you have great conduct in bed,
50:10
you suck at having sex. That's how that works. I ask for misconduct. "Hey, wrap this cord around my neck.
50:18
"Kick me in the nuts. "Tell me my parents have been murdered. I'm trying to come here. Let's go, I'm close!"
50:26
I get accused of mansplaining a lot. That's for sure. Any time I open my mouth now,
50:32
a woman says, "Stop mansplaining." You guys know what mansplaining is? Ladies, if you don't know what mansplaining is, raise your hand.
50:38
I can come by and explain it to you. Do you know what mansplaining is?
50:44
Mansplaining is when a man over-explains something to a woman, because he believes
50:49
she doesn't know what it is, because she is a woman. And it's a tough word to hear as a man,
50:55
because it gets us to evaluate our own behavior, and that's hard for us sometimes.
51:00
But I'm proud to announce that I don't mansplain. I don't over-explain to women. If anything, I over-demonstrate to women, right.
51:07
I'm more of a "man-strater," okay. It's true. That is true, that is true. That is true, that is true.
51:13
I've been known to "man-strate" from time to time.
51:21
It's a good word, "mansplain." Thank you, ladies, for coming up with it. It'll help us be better men for you, right.
51:27
And I think you'll appreciate the word that I came up with for you as well. It's called "woman-reacting," okay,
51:33
and... woman-reacting is when a woman overreacts
51:39
when you tell her the truth.
51:44
Some of you are doing it right now. [chuckles] You can't tell a woman the truth, not 100% the truth.
51:53
You can tell a woman, like, 80% of the truth. I think that's why they only make 80 cents compared to our dollar.
51:59
Don't woman-react. Don't woman-react. Don't you woman-react.
52:05
Don't you woman-react.
52:11
You should be happy, when I wrote that joke, it was 73 cents on the dollar.
52:19
You're a good audience for laughing at that, I'm serious.
52:27
Comedy's tough. Comedy's tough in the U.S. Gender jokes are tough. Race is tough, you know?
52:33
Politics is tough. What's the toughest topic? Guns.
52:39
Guns are the hardest topic to do jokes about.
52:44
You hear how quiet it is now that I even just said guns?
52:49
Guns are tough. It's always tough to do jokes about guns.
52:55
It's always too soon, isn't it? Isn't that sad? We love guns, man.
53:01
I think it should be our greeting, you know? Instead of shaking hands, I think we should just-- [mimics guns firing]
53:07
Greetings take on the culture of its people. That's why in Japan, you bow. In France, you kiss on both cheeks.
53:14
That's our culture. We own 50% of the world's guns. "Oh, you're American? Nice to meet ya." [mimics guns firing]
53:24
It's the second thing we wrote.
53:30
It's the second thing we wrote. Out of all the things to write when starting a country,
53:38
the second thing they wrote down is, "You better get a gun."
53:44
The first thing they wrote down is, "You can say what you want," and then they were like, "But you better get a gun if you wanna do that."
53:55
We wrote that before women's rights, slavery, healthcare. That's high.
54:01
Two is high, everybody. Even Germany's number two wasn't "Arm every citizen with a deadly weapon."
54:09
And that's what gun lovers tell you. Many people probably in this room will tell you, "Look, man, Second Amendment: the right to bear arms."
54:15
And they're fucking right. That's what it says. My only criticism of that amendment is, when it was written, arms were
54:22
a little different, weren't they? In the late 1780's? Arms was a musket. It was 28-feet long.
54:29
It took 12 minutes to reload it. You shot, like, a warped marble, you know,
54:35
that even if I aimed at him, it would hit her in the shoulder. A mass shooting would take nine hours.
54:42
Two shots fired. Nobody injured or killed.
54:47
What do those words mean? What do the words "the right to bear arms" mean? Maybe we misinterpreted them?
54:53
Maybe it's the right to show your arms, you know, huh? Sun's out, guns out. That's where that comes from.
55:02
People misinterpreted things all the time back then. Muslims believe if you die a martyr, you go to heaven,
55:08
you get 72 virgins, but depending on what translation you use for the word "virgins," it could also mean raisins.
55:15
Do you know that? You might get 72 raisins.
55:22
Still good. I'm just saying, if they fucked that up,
55:28
maybe we fucked up the arms thing, you know? I'm not anti-gun.
55:35
I can feel some of you in the balcony putting your scopes on your rifles. I'm not anti-gun.
55:42
I wanted to get a gun. I thought about it. And then I thought about how often I reach in my garbage disposal when it's turned on,
55:48
and I was like, "You know what, "maybe I don't need a deadly weapon flying around the house."
55:56
I do that joke in New York, and people go, "He has a garbage disposal?"
56:04
[chuckles] It's just sad. Yesterday, there was a mass shooting.
56:12
And I don't even know when this is going to air, but that last sentence will remain relevant.
56:17
Isn't that fucking sad? Las Vegas is sad, El Paso, Parkland,
56:22
Newtown, San Diego, I mean, Killeen, Texas. You can't even name them all. You can't even name them all, right?
56:29
Orlando, the guy who shot up the gay nightclub. Not the gays! They love everybody, man.
56:37
We have a gun problem. Hate to break it to you, we have a gun problem, but we can't touch the second amendment.
56:43
It's a tough problem to solve. Politicians are not going to solve it, but maybe a comedian can.
56:48
I have three solutions to solve the United States' gun problem. You guys wanna hear them? Here we go.
56:56
First solution: You only get two guns. That's the max. You can have a short gun
57:01
and you can have a long gun, okay? You can't have 586 guns. Second solution: Women, you can have
57:08
as many guns as you want, all right? Bazookas, armored helicopters, Uzis,
57:13
swords that shoot bullets, whatever. No women has killed more than two people in this country
57:18
with a gun since 1980, okay? Even the YouTube shooter, she slightly injured two and then killed herself.
57:25
[blows raspberries] All right? Fellas, if you wanna use a gun, you gotta find a woman.
57:31
Ask her. She's going to say, "What's it for? "How long are you going to be gone?
57:36
"Who are you going with? What time can I expect you'll be back?"
57:46
Third solution: If you're a white man with a bad haircut,
57:51
no guns for you, okay? Sorry, Patrick, that sucks, dude, but...
57:58
Hey, my name is Michael Kosta. You guys are the best. Thank you to Michigan. Thank you to Detroit.
58:04
Thank you, New York City. Thank you very much. Thank you, Los Angeles. Thank you to Comedy Central. I love you guys.
58:10
Thank you very much. Good night. [cheers and applause]
58:16
If this comedy special doesn't win an Emmy, I put this dog down, okay?
