Comedy Central presents

Patton Oswalt
0:17
( applause and cheers )
0:26
THANK YOU.
0:29
THANKS.
0:30
AW, THANK YOU ALL FOR COMING OUT.
0:32
THIS MAKES IT NICE HAVING AN AUDIENCE FOR MY SPECIAL.
0:35
THANK YOU... VERY MUCH.
0:37
YOU KNOW... REMEMBER WHEN YOU WERE A LITTLE KID
0:39
AND, UH, YOUR FRIENDS WOULD BE OUT PLAYING A GAME--
0:42
LIKE, UH, "COWBOYS AND INDIANS" OR "FORT"--
0:44
SOME GAME WHERE THERE WAS, LIKE, FAKE BOUNDARIES?
0:47
SO THEY WOULD SAY:
0:48
"OKAY, UH, THE BIKE PATH OVER AT THE SKAFFETYS' IS LAVA
0:53
"AND IF YOU TOUCH THAT, YOU'RE DEAD.
0:55
"AND THEN THE HEDGES OVER AT THE SLINGERLANDS' ARE POISON SNAKES.
0:58
"AND IF YOU GO OVER THERE
1:00
"THEY'LL BITE YOU AND YOU'RE DEAD.
1:02
AND THOSE ARE THE BOUNDARIES."
1:04
BUT YOU WEREN'T THERE WHEN THEY STARTED PLAYING...
1:06
LIKE, YOU SHOW UP LATER 'CAUSE YOU'RE GOING TO THE POOL.
1:08
YOU'RE, LIKE, "HEY, GUYS, WE'RE GOING TO GO TO THE POOL."
1:11
AND THEY SAY, "HEY, DON'T TOUCH THE BIKE PATH, IT'S LAVA!
1:14
DON'T... THE HEDGES ARE SNAKES!"
1:16
AND YOU'VE GOT TO SAY, "OH, I'M NOT...
1:18
"GUYS, I WASN'T HERE WHEN YOU DID ALL THAT.
1:21
"I'M JUST GOING TO THE POOL.
1:22
IT DOESN'T AFFECT ME."
1:24
DO YOU KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT?
1:26
THAT'S PRETTY MUCH HOW I TREAT THE POT LAWS IN THIS COUNTRY.
1:29
KIND OF THE SAME WAY, YOU KNOW, JUST THE WHOLE...
1:32
PATTON, YOU... YOU CAN'T...
1:34
( audience whooping )
1:36
"YOU CAN'T HAVE THAT, IT'S ILLEGAL."
1:39
IT... OH, I'M NOT...
1:40
GO AHEAD, I WASN'T HERE WHEN YOU DID ALL THAT.
1:43
YEAH, I KNOW.
1:44
OKAY, DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.
1:45
I KNOW, IT'S "LAVA."
1:47
IT'S JUST MARIJUANA. DON'T WORRY.
1:48
SEE? IT'S FINE.
1:50
DON'T WORRY.
1:52
I DON'T LIKE READING THE OBITUARIES, BUT I...
1:55
I READ THE OBITUARIES A LOT BECAUSE IT JUST SEEMS TO ME
1:58
THAT PEOPLE THAT WRITE THE OBITUARIES
2:00
EITHER WANT TO BE P.R. PEOPLE
2:01
OR THEY'RE FAILED P.R. PEOPLE
2:03
AND THEY, YOU KNOW, THEY'RE TRYING TO KEEP IT GOING.
2:06
"HEY, LOOK, I SPUN DEATH."
2:07
UH, FOR INSTANCE, IN THE OBITUARIES
2:09
NO ONE EVER DIES OF CANCER
2:11
PEOPLE ALWAYS "GIVE IN AFTER A VALIANT BATTLE WITH CANCER"
2:15
OR THEY "THROW IN THE TOWEL AFTER A COURAGEOUS FIGHT."
2:18
WHICH, STATISTICALLY, THAT CAN'T BE POSSIBLE.
2:20
THERE HAD TO HAVE BEEN A COUPLE OF COWARDLY ORDEALS IN THERE.
2:23
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?
2:25
LIKE: "BOB SMITH DIED TODAY
2:27
"AFTER A CRAVEN, COWARDLY ORDEAL WITH CANCER
2:29
"DURING WHICH HE WISHED THE DISEASE
2:31
"ON HIS FAMILY AND FRIENDS...
2:33
( audience laughing )
2:34
"AND ATTEMPTED A PACT WITH SATAN
2:36
"WHICH LEFT HIS BASEMENT COVERED IN GOAT'S BLOOD AND...
2:39
"FOUR BOXES OF CHALK NEEDLESSLY WASTED
2:41
"TRYING TO SUMMON A DEMON WHO NEVER APPEARED.
2:44
"THE FEW MOURNERS WHO SHOWED UP AT THIS FUNERAL
2:46
"HAD A HARD TIME NOT GIGGLING.
2:48
GOOD RIDDANCE."
2:50
MY OTHER BIG OBITUARY FEAR IS
2:53
WHEN I DIE, THEY'LL HAVE MY PICTURE
2:54
AND THEN THEY ALWAYS HAVE UNDERNEATH IT, IN QUOTES:
2:57
"HE LOVED TO LAUGH.
2:58
OH, HE LOVED TO LAUGH!"
3:00
WELL, THAT DOESN'T TELL YOU ANYTHING.
3:02
HEY, EVERYBODY LOVES TO LAUGH. YOU'RE LAUGHING.
3:04
THAT'S LIKE SAYING:
3:05
"HE HUNGERED FOR FOOD SO OFTEN IN HIS LIFE.
3:08
"HE GOT THESE INSANE CRAVINGS.
3:10
"HE TRIED TO GIVE IT UP.
3:13
"HE'D HAVE A BIG BREAKFAST AND SAY, 'THAT'S IT! COLD TURKEY!'
3:16
"AND THEN AT LUNCH, HE'D WANT SOME COLD TURKEY.
3:19
"IT WAS PATHETIC.
3:20
"BATTLED IT ALONGSIDE OF HIS SLEEP ADDICTION.
3:23
"OH, THAT SLEEP ADDICTION WAS A MONKEY ON HIS BACK.
3:27
"HE'D GO 18, 20 HOURS, BUT SOONER OR LATER
3:30
"HE'D LOOK FOR A 'BED' TO 'LIE DOWN IN'
3:34
"AS THE CRAZY SLEEP JUNKIES WOULD SAY
3:36
"IN THAT WEIRD STREET LINGO OF THEIRS:
3:38
"I'M GOING TO GO TAKE A 'NAP.'
3:39
WHAT'S THAT HEP CAT SAYING?"
3:42
ALTHOUGH, I CAN'T THINK OF ANYTHING CREEPIER
3:44
THAN WATCHING SOMEONE LAUGH
3:46
WHO HATES TO LAUGH.
3:47
HOW DISTURBING WOULD THAT LOOK?
3:49
YOU TELL THEM AND JOKE AND THEY'RE, LIKE:
3:51
"OH, LAUGHTER!"
3:53
( growling )
3:58
LOOK AT MY SET. THEY BUILT ME A SET.
4:00
OH, ALL THE MONEY.
4:02
I LIVE IN LOS ANGELES RIGHT NOW.
4:03
I LOVE GOING TO, LIKE, OLD MOVIES.
4:05
I'M A REAL FILM BUFF.
4:07
AND LOS ANGELES IS THE PLACE TO GO TO A LOT OF MOVIES.
4:09
THEY SHOW OLD MOVIES ALL THE TIME.
4:11
BUT, UNFORTUNATELY, YOU HAVE TO WATCH THEM
4:14
WITH PEOPLE THAT LIVE IN LOS ANGELES.
4:15
AND A LOT OF THEM, THEY'LL GO TO THESE OLD MOVIES
4:18
BUT THEY'LL BRING THEIR BULL( beep )
4:19
LIKE, STARBUCKS LIBERALISM WITH THEM.
4:21
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?
4:22
AS IF IT STILL APPLIES TO THE MOVIES THAT THEY'RE WATCHING.
4:25
LIKE, THEY WERE SHOWING JOHN WAYNE'S THE SEARCHERS.
4:27
THE SEARCHERS--
4:29
ONE OF THE GREATEST FILMS EVER MADE.
4:30
WE'RE WATCHING IT IN THE MANN'S CHINESE--
4:32
"OH, MAN, THIS IS AMAZING." SO THE MOVIE STARTS UP.
4:34
THE FIRST TITLE COMES UP:
4:36
"TEXAS, 1868."
4:38
TEXAS.
4:39
1868.
4:41
SO THIS WOMAN TWO SEATS DOWN FROM ME
4:43
STARTS REACTING TO THE FILM AS IF IT WERE MADE TODAY.
4:46
SHE STARTS GOING: "OH, WELL, LET THE WOMEN CLEAR THE TABLE
4:49
"WHILE THE MEN JUST SIT THERE AND TALK; OKAY.
4:51
"AND LET'S ALL BE RACIST TO THE INDIANS WHILE WE'RE AT IT.
4:54
THAT'S GOOD."
4:55
UM...
4:56
MA'AM, IT'S THE OLD WEST, OKAY?
4:59
IT WAS SETTLED BY BIG, WHITE, RACIST PSYCHOPATHS.
5:01
I'M SORRY, THOSE ARE THE GUYS THAT SETTLED IT.
5:04
IT WASN'T SETTLED BY GAP GREETERS
5:06
AND JAMBA JUICE EMPLOYEES ON THEIR BREAK.
5:08
IT WOULD'VE BEEN NICE, BUT NO.
5:10
NO.
5:12
WHAT ARE YOU THINKING?
5:15
IF I HAD SETTLED THIS COUNTRY
5:16
WE'D BE DEAD RIGHT NOW. YOU'D BE DEAD.
5:18
'CAUSE I'D HAVE BEEN OUT THERE GOING, "AH, MY INNER CHILD
5:21
DOESN'T FEEL LIKE CHOPPING WOOD TODAY; I HAVE A..."
5:24
"WE'RE GOING TO DIE, YOU IDIOT!"
5:26
"I KNOW, BUT I WAS READING, UH, ANDREA DWORKIN
5:29
AND SHE SAYS THE MALES..."
5:30
"PLEASE KILL AN ANIMAL SO WE CAN EAT!
5:33
PLEASE!"
5:38
I WAS, UH...
5:40
WE'RE AT WAR, RIGHT?
5:41
I-I'M ONLY... I'M ONLY SAYING "WE'RE AT WAR"
5:44
BECAUSE I TURNED ON CNN LAST WEEK
5:46
AND THERE WAS A GREEN CITY ON TV.
5:48
WHENEVER YOU TURN ON CNN AND THERE'S A GREEN CITY
5:51
WITH WHITE DOTS OVER IT
5:52
YOU'RE LIKE, "OH, OH, I GUESS WE NEED OIL.
5:54
"HEY, HONEY, WE SHOULD GO FILL THE CAR UP.
5:57
THE OIL PRICES..."
5:58
AS I SPEAK TO MY WIFE WHO DOESN'T EXIST.
6:00
"HONEY, WE SHOULD GO GET..."
6:04
THE... MY PHANTOM WIFE.
6:06
UM...
6:07
THESE WAR REPORTERS, TOO, FOR CNN
6:09
THEY TRY TO MAKE OUT LIKE THEY'RE STILL
6:11
THAT WHOLE EDWARD MURROW:
6:12
"I'M IN LONDON WHILE THEY'RE BOMBING US."
6:14
OR "I'M IN THE JUNGLES OF VIETNAM."
6:16
THESE GUYS ARE IN A DAYS INN
6:17
MILES AWAY FROM THE SHELLING
6:19
STILL TRYING TO COME ON LIKE THEY'RE KING SWAGGERCOCK.
6:21
"YEAH, I'M IN THE MIDDLE OF THE WAR-- LOOK OUT."
6:24
AND THESE GUYS TRY TO PLAY IT UP, LIKE:
6:26
YES, WE'RE IN THE DAYS INN.
6:27
THE SHELLING HAS STARTED.
6:29
WE'VE LOST SPECTRAVISION, BERNIE, WE HAVE... UH...
6:32
I'M NOT... I DON'T KNOW HOW BLADE ENDS.
6:34
WESLEY WAS FIGHTING THE VAMPIRES
6:36
AND HE LOOKED LIKE HE WAS DOING WELL, BUT WHO KNOWS?
6:39
IT'S JUST... IT'S PURE HELL, BERNIE.
6:41
IT IS PURE... BLACK IS WHITE, WHITE IS BLACK. IT'S CHAOS.
6:44
I ORDERED A SANDWICH.
6:46
I SPECIFICALLY SAID, "NO MAYONNAISE."
6:49
THE SANDWICH CAME SLATHERED, BERNIE
6:52
"SLATHERED" IS THE ONLY WORD I CAN USE
6:54
FOR THE AMOUNT OF MAYONNAISE...
6:56
WE... WE SENT IT BACK.
6:58
WE'RE PRAYING THAT--
6:59
PLEASE KEEP US IN YOUR PRAYERS--
7:01
THAT THE SANDWICH WILL COME BACK WITH NO MAYONNAISE.
7:03
MUSTARD ON THE SIDE, I KNOW IS WAY TOO MUCH TO HOPE FOR
7:06
BUT JUST THE "NO MAYONNAISE" WOULD GIVE ME
7:08
SOME SEMBLANCE OF SANITY.
7:10
BERNIE, THE SANDWICHES ARE HERE.
7:12
THEY'RE WHEELING THE SANDWICHES IN.
7:14
WE'RE GOING TO LOOK.
7:15
THERE'S NO MAYONNAISE ON MY SANDWICH, BERNIE.
7:17
THERE IS NO MAYONNAISE.
7:19
GOD BLESS AMERICA.
7:23
GOD BLESS AMERICA.
7:26
IT'S REALLY GREAT TO BE, UH, IN NEW YORK RIGHT NOW.
7:30
THIS IS A TERRIFIC CITY
7:31
BUT IT DOES NOT HOLD A CANDLE TO AMSTERDAM.
7:34
I WENT TO AMSTERDAM LAST YEAR.
7:36
HAS ANYBODY EVER BEEN THERE?
7:38
OH, MAN!
7:39
I WAS LIKE TEMPLETON THE RAT IN CHARLOTTE'S WEB
7:42
JUST RUNNING AROUND:
7:43
"OH, HOOKERS AND POT!"
7:44
IT WAS UNBELIEVABLE.
7:47
AND BEING, LIKE, A TYPICAL AMERICAN JACKASS
7:51
I DECIDED TO GO TO THE COFFEE SHOPS AND GET A LITTLE MARIJUANA
7:54
UM, 'CAUSE THAT'S WHAT AMERICANS DO.
7:56
SO, UM... AND I WAS LIKE GOLDILOCKS.
7:58
I WAS SO SELECTIVE.
7:59
THIS SHOP'S TOO NEW WAVE.
8:01
THIS ONE'S TOO REGGAE.
8:03
AND I FOUND THE PERFECT SHOP.
8:04
IT WAS CALLED "THE DOLPHIN" ON THE KEIZERSGRACHT.
8:07
YOU KNOW HOW I KNEW IT WAS PERFECT?
8:08
'CAUSE THE MIX TAPE WHEN I WENT IN--
8:10
SUPERGRASS, ELVIS COSTELLO AND THE BEASTIE BOYS--
8:12
THE HOLY TRIUMVIRATE!
8:14
SO, NOW, THE STORY THAT
8:15
I'M GOING TO HAVE TO TELL IS TRUE.
8:16
THIS ALL HAPPENED...
8:18
AND I WISH IT DIDN'T...
8:19
'CAUSE IT SOUNDS FAKE.
8:21
BUT THIS ALL HAPPENED THE WAY I'M ABOUT TO DESCRIBE IT.
8:23
I... IT SOUNDS VERY ZEMECKIS, BUT IT'S REAL.
8:26
AND KEEP IN MIND THAT IT'S 4:30 IN THE AFTERNOON
8:28
WHEN THIS HAPPENS
8:30
WHICH MEANT IT WAS 8:30 IN THE MORNING BACK IN LOS ANGELES.
8:33
SO PLEASE KEEP THAT IN MIND.
8:35
SO I GO IN AND, UH... I ASK TO SEE THE POT MENU.
8:38
NOW, WHEN YOU GO INTO THE COFFEE SHOPS
8:40
AND YOU WANT TO SEE THE POT MENU
8:42
THEY EITHER BRING OUT A THREE-RING BINDER
8:44
WITH THEM ALL IN POCKETS
8:46
OR IN THIS CASE, SHE BROUGHT OUT THIS TACKLE BOX
8:49
THAT SHE OPENED LIKE A FLOWER OF JOY.
8:51
AND...
8:52
SO I'M LOOKING AT ALL THESE.
8:54
AND I'M TRYING TO BE ALL DEREK FLINT, MATT HELM
8:56
INTERNATIONAL COOL, LIKE:
8:57
THE THAI LOOKS A LITTLE SHAGGY
8:58
I DON'T KNOW... YEAH.
8:59
OF COURSE, INSIDE, I'M LIKE...
9:01
( wild laughter )
9:02
WHOO!
9:03
SO...
9:05
FINALLY, I SAY, "LOOK, I'M NOT GOING TO DO ANYTHING
9:07
"FOR THE NEXT COUPLE OF DAYS
9:08
"SO JUST GIVE ME SOMETHING
9:10
THAT'S GOING TO GET RIGHT ON TOP OF MY BOO-BOO."
9:12
AND SHE SAID, "YOU WANT THE WHITE WIDOW FROM AFGHANISTAN."
9:15
SO, I GO, "YEAH, I'LL TAKE THE WHITE WIDOW."
9:17
NOW SHE SHOULD HAVE WARNED ME, THOUGH
9:19
THE BEST MARIJUANA YOU SMOKE IN THE UNITED STATES
9:21
YOU MAY AS WELL BE SMOKING SHOELACES
9:23
COMPARED TO THE STUFF THEY HAVE OVER THERE.
9:25
AND THE BUD SHE SELECTED FOR ME
9:26
LEFT ITS PARENTS ON KRYPTON, ALL RIGHT?
9:28
SO SHE... STARTS... MAKING...
9:32
LIKE, SHE GOES, "I CAN PUT IT IN A COOKIE
9:34
I CAN MAKE TEA OR I CAN ROLL YOU A JOINT."
9:36
AND I SAID, "YOU CAN ROLL ME A JOINT."
9:38
SO... SHE...
9:40
STARTS ROLLING THIS JOINT
9:42
AND TO GIVE YOU AN IDEA OF THE CARE AND CONCERN
9:46
AND CRAFTSMANSHIP THAT WENT INTO MY JOINT
9:49
UM, JUST AS SHE BEGAN ROLLING IT
9:51
QUEEN'S "WE ARE THE CHAMPIONS" STARTED PLAYING ON THE MIX TAPE.
9:54
THAT'S WHAT STARTED PLAYING!
9:56
IT TOOK HER THE ENTIRE SONG TO ROLL IT.
9:58
THE ENTIRE SONG!
9:59
SHE WAS TAKING OUT STEMS AND SEEDS.
10:01
OH, ROLLING IT SO NICE. HI.
10:03
AND...
10:05
SO SHE'S, LIKE, ROLLING IT.
10:06
AND THEN SHE STARTS, LIKE, LICKING IT...
10:08
OH... TO SEAL IT.
10:09
LOOKING RIGHT AT ME.
10:11
I WENT... HI...
10:12
( gibberish )
10:13
AND...
10:15
IT'S 4:30 IN THE AFTERNOON IN AMSTERDAM.
10:18
WHICH MEANT IT WAS 8:30 IN THE MORNING BACK IN L.A.
10:20
IF I HAD KEPT MY WRITING JOB
10:21
ON THIS SKETCH SHOW I USED TO BE ON
10:23
I WOULD JUST THEN BE WAKING UP TO GO IN
10:24
AND PITCH SKETCHES THAT I DON'T WANT TO WRITE.
10:26
LIKE, "I DON'T KNOW
10:27
"HOW ABOUT 'MIDNIGHT
10:29
IN THE OLIVE GARDEN OF GOOD AND EVIL?'
10:30
AW, WHAT? COME ON!"
10:32
INSTEAD, I'M IN AMSTERDAM IN A COFFEE SHOP
10:34
WHERE THIS BLONDE, NORDIC GIANTESS
10:36
IS CAREFULLY LICKING MY JOINT CLOSED
10:38
WHILE QUEEN'S "WE ARE THE CHAMPIONS" PLAYS ON A MIX TAPE.
10:42
MY LIFE ROCKED!
10:43
( applause and cheers )
10:45
FOR A MINUTE!
10:48
AND I VISITED THE ANNE FRANK HOUSE.
10:50
IF YOU GO TO AMSTERDAM
10:51
YOU'VE GOT TO GO TO THE ANNE FRANK HOUSE.
10:53
NO, IT WAS REALLY EMOTIONAL. IT WAS REALLY SPIRITUAL.
10:56
I JUST COULDN'T BELIEVE IT.
10:57
YOU GO IN AND IT'S THE ACTUAL HOUSE.
10:58
BUT I DIDN'T KNOW THAT YOU HAD TO PAY TO GET IN.
11:01
I THOUGHT YOU COULD JUST...
11:02
IT WAS A HISTORICAL...
11:03
I THOUGHT YOU JUST GO IN AND YOU TAKE THE TOUR.
11:05
AND THERE'S THIS BIG BOOTH IN THE LOBBY
11:07
AND I THOUGHT, "WELL, THAT'S AN INFORMATION BOOTH."
11:09
AND I JUST BREEZED ON BY, UPSTAIRS I WENT-- WHOO.
11:12
STARTED TAKING THE TOUR.
11:14
SO THE WOMAN DOWNSTAIRS IS, LIKE:
11:16
"DID THAT GUY JUST NOT PAY?
11:18
HE DIDN'T PAY."
11:19
SO SHE COMES UP THE STAIRS AFTER ME.
11:21
NOW, WHEN I GO TO OTHER COUNTRIES
11:22
THIS IS GOING TO SOUND KIND OF LAME
11:24
BUT I SORT OF THINK OF MYSELF AS AN AMBASSADOR
11:25
INSOFAR AS I DON'T WANT TO BE A TYPICAL AMERICAN DOUCHE NOZZLE.
11:28
AND GETTING THROWN OUT OF THE ANNE FRANK HOUSE?
11:30
THAT'S IT.
11:32
I MEAN, YOU'VE WON THE DOUCHE NOZZLE SWEEPSTAKES, SO...
11:36
SHE'S LOOKING FOR ME
11:37
AND I'M... I'M ALREADY ON THE THIRD FLOOR.
11:39
I'M, LIKE, "OH, MAN, WHAT DO I DO?"
11:40
SO I HID BEHIND THIS BOOKCASE ON THE THIRD FLOOR.
11:43
I DIDN'T KNOW WHERE ELSE TO GO.
11:44
SO... SHE WAS LOOKING FOR ME FOR, LIKE, HALF AN HOUR
11:47
SO I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO DO
11:49
SO I KEPT THIS DIARY WHILE I WAS BACK THERE
11:51
'CAUSE I WAS JUST BORED
11:52
I DIDN'T, YOU KNOW, I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT WAS GOING TO HAPPEN.
11:55
SO I'D LIKE TO READ AN EXCERPT FROM THE DIARY THAT I KEPT
11:58
WHILE I WAS THERE.
11:59
( clears throat )
12:01
"SATURDAY, JANUARY 10:
12:02
"I DIDN'T KNOW THAT YOU HAD TO PAY
12:05
"TO GET INTO THE ANNE FRANK HOUSE...
12:08
"AND NOW I'M HIDING BEHIND A BOOKCASE ON THE THIRD FLOOR.
12:11
"WHEN WILL PEOPLE LEARN THAT YOU HAVE TO MAKE IT CLEAR
12:14
"WHEN YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO PAY TO GET INTO A HISTORIC LANDMARK
12:17
"LIKE THE ANNE FRANK HOUSE
12:19
"SO THAT PEOPLE LIKE ME NEED NOT LIVE IN FEAR?
12:22
"STILL, I BELIEVE PEOPLE ARE BASICALLY GOOD.
12:24
"AND I HOPE SOMEDAY TO HAVE A GIRLFRIEND
12:26
WHO WILL LET ME FEEL HER BREASTS."
12:28
NOW THAT'S JUST AN EXCERPT. I DIDN'T...
12:30
I HAD TO LEAVE MY DIARY THERE WHEN I FLED
12:32
AND, UH, I JUST HOPE THEY PRINT THAT
12:34
SO PEOPLE CAN LEARN FROM MY MISTAKE.
12:37
SO... I'M 30 NOW.
12:39
I JUST TURNED 30, AND, UH... WHICH MEANS I'M GETTING OLDER.
12:42
AND YOU KNOW WHAT I'VE REALIZED?
12:44
YOU CAN GROW OLD TWO WAYS.
12:46
YOU CAN EITHER GROW OLD IN WHICH YOU HATE EVERYTHING
12:48
AND YOU JUST... "YOU KIDS WITH YOUR ROBOT SERVANTS"
12:51
OR YOU CAN GROW OLD LIKE ME
12:53
IN WHICH YOU LOSE YOUR LOVE AND HATRED OF EVERYTHING, YOU KNOW?
12:57
MY SCALE OF LOVE AND HATRED USED TO GO
13:00
FROM "OH, YEAH, REALLY?! WHOO!"
13:02
TO, "OH, NO WAY! OH, GET... NO!"
13:07
NOW, THE SCALE GOES...
13:09
HERE'S MY SCALE. READY?
13:11
( low-key ): "AH, THAT'S... MM-HMM..."
13:13
TO...
13:14
( really low-key ): "AH, WELL... HUH."
13:16
YEAH! I DON'T KNOW.
13:18
( cheering and applause )
13:20
YEAH, OKAY. THAT'S RIGHT.
13:22
SO, UH...
13:24
REMEMBER WHEN YOU WERE GROWING UP
13:26
AND YOU WANTED TO COLOR EGGS FOR EASTER?
13:28
WHERE DID YOU GO?
13:30
THERE WAS ONLY ONE GAME IN TOWN-- PAAS.
13:32
YOU WENT TO PAAS OR YOU WENT TO HELL.
13:35
REMEMBER THAT? THAT WAS ON THE BOX, AND, UM...
13:37
'CAUSE THEY HAD THE MONOPOLY. THEY COULD SAY THAT.
13:39
REMEMBER WHEN YOU GOT THE KIT? WHAT DID YOU GET?
13:42
YOU GOT THE LITTLE COLOR TABLETS. REMEMBER THOSE?
13:44
AND YOU PUT THEM IN THE WATER
13:45
AND THE WATER WOULD SMELL LIKE A VINEGAR FART
13:47
AND THEN YOU WOULD TAKE THE EGG AND PUT THE EGG
13:50
IN THE LITTLE WIRE SEAT.
13:51
REMEMBER THAT? THAT LITTLE TORTURE SEAT.
13:53
"LOWER YOU TO YOUR DOOM.
13:55
SCREAM ALL YOU WANT."
13:57
OR LIKE ME, YOU'D PUT ALL THE TABLETS INTO ONE GLASS
14:01
AND THAT WOULD TURN THE EGGS BROWN.
14:03
"OH, CAN'T GET BROWN EGGS, PATTON.
14:05
THAT'S OUR LITTLE PRODIGY."
14:08
THEN, UM, YOU COULD PUNCH OUT THE BACK OF THE BOX--
14:10
REMEMBER THAT?-- AND MAKE A LITTLE EGG HOLDER.
14:13
AH, REMEMBER THAT?
14:14
BUT LIKE ME, YOU WOULDN'T WAIT FOR THE EGGS TO DRY
14:16
AND THEN THE BOX WOULD DISSOLVE
14:18
AND YOUR DAD WOULD START DRINKING.
14:20
THAT'S NOT IMPORTANT.
14:21
WHAT'S IMPORTANT IS THAT THAT IS ALL THE KIT CAME WITH.
14:23
BUT THEN, REMEMBER IN THE '70s
14:26
ALL THOSE UPSTART COMPANIES CAME ALONG
14:28
TRYING TO UNSEAT THE PAAS DYNASTY?
14:30
THERE WAS "SHAKE AN EGG." REMEMBER SHAKE AN EGG?
14:33
YOU PUT THE EGG IN THE BAG WITH THE GLITTER
14:35
AND IT CAME OUT LOOKING ALL GLAM-ROCKY
14:37
LIKE IT FELL OUT OF DAVID BOWIE'S ASS.
14:39
"HEY, LOOK, HAPPY EASTER.
14:40
BANG A GONG, EVERYBODY."
14:43
AND THEN RONCO CAME OUT WITH THAT WEIRD INQUISITION CLAMP.
14:45
REMEMBER THAT?
14:46
YOU'D PUT THE EGG IN THE CLAMP, AND THEN YOU PUT
14:49
THE MAGIC MARKER IN THE CLAMP HERE
14:51
AND THEN YOU'D TURN THE EGG...
14:52
OH...
14:55
"OH, A LINE... THERE'S A LINE ON THE EGG.
15:00
IT'S 4:00 O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING."
15:03
( applause )
15:04
I WENT BACK IN THE DRUGSTORE RECENTLY
15:06
LOOKING FOR EGG-COLORING KITS.
15:08
THERE'S ONLY ONE COMPANY STANDING--
15:10
PAAS, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN.
15:12
PAAS.
15:14
( cheering )
15:15
AND WHEN YOU GET THE KIT...
15:18
YOU BUY THAT KIT, YOU KNOW WHAT YOU GET?
15:20
YOU GET FIVE COLOR TABLETS, A LITTLE WIRE THING...
15:22
THEY DIDN'T CHANGE A THING!
15:23
WHAT CHROME-PLATED BALLS ON THOSE GUYS.
15:25
THEY DIDN'T...
15:27
I JUST IMAGINE THEIR FOUNDER, SOME GUY NAMED HENRY PAAS GOING
15:30
"LET 'EM GO TO THEIR LITTLE SHAKE AN EGG
15:32
"AND THEIR RONCO THINGS.
15:33
"THEY'LL COME CRAWLING BACK.
15:35
"WE'RE PAAS.
15:37
"MY FATHER STARTED THIS COMPANY WITH ONE COLOR TABLET
15:40
"AND IT WAS WHITE, AND WE WERE THANKFUL.
15:45
"PAAS.
15:47
"HAPPY EASTER AND BITE MY WRINKLY ( bleep ).
15:53
PUT THAT ON THE BOX."
15:58
CAN WE SAY "BITE MY WRINKLY ( bleep )"?
16:00
I GUESS WE'RE GOING TO FIND OUT.
16:02
THANK YOU VERY MUCH, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN.
16:05
I LOVE HOW TV IS SO GOOD RIGHT NOW.
16:07
THERE'S A LOT OF REALLY GOOD SHOWS ON TV
16:10
AND WHAT'S GREAT ABOUT ALL THESE GOOD SHOWS BEING ON TV
16:13
IS IT MAKES THE BAD SHOWS LOOK AN INFECTED 'RHOID--
16:15
LIKE THEY REALLY STAND OUT.
16:17
UM, FOR INSTANCE, ESPECIALLY LIKE THE FOX NETWORK
16:19
IS STARTING TO REALIZE THAT, YOU KNOW
16:21
"EXCEPT FOR THE SIMPSONS AND THE X FILES
16:23
AND KING OF THE HILL, OUR NETWORK SORT OF SUCKS."
16:26
SO THEY'RE STARTING TO SHOW JUST VIDEOS OF THINGS
16:28
LIKE WORLD'S SCARIEST POLICE CHASES
16:30
AND WHEN THINGS GO WRONG
16:31
AND THEY SHOW A GUY IN A PARACHUTE-- "AHH!"--
16:34
JUST FALLING.
16:35
IT'S ALWAYS THE SAME GUY-- "AHH!"
16:37
AND THAT'S COOL. I'LL WATCH THOSE SHOWS, BUT THEN RECENTLY
16:40
THEY REALLY HIT THE BOTTOM OF THE BARREL
16:42
BECAUSE THEY SHOWED A SHOW
16:43
CALLED FOX'S MOST SHOCKING MEDICAL VIDEOS.
16:46
DID ANYONE SEE THIS SHOW?
16:47
MOST SHOCKING MEDICAL VIDEOS.
16:49
OKAY. COUPLE THINGS.
16:51
NUMBER ONE: ALL MEDICAL VIDEOS ARE SHOCKING.
16:54
THEY'RE MEDICAL VIDEOS, FOR GOD'S SAKES.
16:57
THERE'S NO SOOTHING MEDICAL VIDEOS.
16:59
IT'S NOT LIKE, "WELL, THE STUFFING'S TAKING FOREVER
17:02
"SO LET'S WATCH THIS EPISIOTOMY FOOTAGE THAT I HAVE.
17:04
WHEN THE BONE SAW HITS THE LIGAMENTS, IT'S A SYMPHONY."
17:09
UM... THE OTHER THING IS, DURING THE WHOLE SPECIAL
17:11
THEY KEPT TRYING TO SHOW YOU... THEY KEPT TRYING TO TELL YOU
17:14
"WELL, YOU'RE GOING TO LEARN SOMETHING ABOUT MEDICAL SCIENCE.
17:17
"THIS IS A VERY EDUCATIONAL SHOW
17:19
AND YOU LEARN ABOUT THE WONDERS OF SCIENCE."
17:21
NO, NO. THIS IS ALL WET ASS HOUR SURGERY
17:23
WHEN THE BOTTOM HAS FALLEN THROUGH THE BASEMENT
17:25
AND SOME GUY COMES IN WITH AN ELK'S LEG UP HIS ASS
17:27
AND THE DOCTOR'S, LIKE
17:29
"AH, HA-HA-HA.
17:30
"UH... UH, I DON'T HAVE A...
17:34
"THERE'S NO ELK/ASS CHAPTER OF THE GRAY'S ANATOMY.
17:37
"UM... GET SOME, UH, TONGS, AND...
17:40
"SOME BUTTER. I DON'T KNOW.
17:42
UH... I DIDN'T TRAIN FOR THIS."
17:45
I THINK THE BOTTOM MOMENT OF THE SPECIAL CAME
17:48
WHEN THIS GUY...
17:49
THERE WAS A GUY THAT WENT UP IN THE HIMALAYAS
17:52
AND HE GOT EXTREME FROSTBITE
17:54
AND HIS FACE TURNED BLACK AND THEN FELL OFF.
17:58
HIS FACE FELL OFF.
18:00
SO, THE DOCTORS ARE RECONSTRUCTING HIS FACE
18:02
AND NOW HE'S GOT NO NOSE.
18:04
SO HE HAS OPTIONS.
18:06
OH, HE'S GOT OPTIONS NOW.
18:08
OPTION NUMBER ONE IS TO GET THIS FAKE, CLIP-ON NOSE.
18:10
IT'S A FAKE, HARD PLASTIC NOSE
18:12
AND THEY PUT THESE METAL STUDS AND YOU-- KACHOONK-- CLIP IT ON
18:15
AND THEY SHOW A GUY WITH NO NOSE AND THE GUY CLIPS IT ON
18:19
AND HE LOOKED OKAY.
18:21
IT LOOKED LIKE... HE LOOKED FINE.
18:22
BUT THIS GUY SAID, "OH, PHOOEY AND PSHAW!
18:26
"NO FAKE NOSE FOR ME.
18:27
"THAT'S ALL FLUMMERY.
18:29
I WANT SOMETHING REAL."
18:31
SO THE DOCTORS CONSULT THIS ANCIENT SANSKRIT MEDICAL TEXT.
18:35
WHY THEY ARE CONSULTING AN ANCIENT SANSKRIT MEDICAL TEXT--
18:39
BEYOND ME-- BUT THERE'S A WAY THEY CAN TAKE SKIN AND FAT
18:43
FROM OTHER PARTS OF YOUR BODY AND GROW APPENDAGES.
18:46
SO THEY MAKE A NOSE OUT OF, LIKE, ASS FAT AND THIGH SKIN
18:50
AND THEY GROW IT UPSIDE DOWN ON HIS FOREHEAD.
18:54
SO FOR A YEAR
18:56
HE HAS A HOLE IN HIS FACE AND AN UPSIDE-DOWN NOSE.
19:00
"AHH!"
19:02
GOING TO RESTAURANTS, CATCHING A FLICK...
19:04
"OH, MY GOD!"
19:07
THEN THEY TAKE THE ASS FAT NOSE, SEW IT OVER THE NOSE HOLE
19:11
AND THEY SHOW HIM WITH HIS NEW, NATURAL-LOOKING NOSE
19:15
AND IT LOOKED HORRIFYING.
19:17
OH, MY GOD.
19:19
IF MY FACE EVER FELL OFF
19:21
I WOULD HAVE THE PRESENCE OF MIND TO KILL MYSELF.
19:24
I WOULD NOT HANG AROUND MR. SOPPY GOB-FACE
19:26
CLINGING ONTO LIFE.
19:28
( speaking gibberish )
19:29
"OH, MY GOD, WHAT'S WRONG WITH HIM?"
19:31
"HE LOVES LIFE. HE WON'T LET GO."
19:33
( speaking gibberish )
19:35
"OH, GOD, PLEASE KILL YOURSELF."
19:37
THANK YOU VERY MUCH, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN.
19:40
GOOD NIGHT. THANK YOU.
19:42
THANKS A LOT.
19:44
( cheering and applause )
