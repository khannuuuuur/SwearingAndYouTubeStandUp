Let me tell you the reason, I'm Nigerian, all right?
0:35
A hundred percent.
0:36
And that's just the thing about Nigerians.
0:38
Wherever there's a school,

wherever there's a school, there's a Nigerian, man.
0:43
Doesn't matter.

No, he's a smart man, he's a wizard.
1:10
He told me.
1:11

He said he's so excited, he cannot wait
1:15
to show me the ropes.
1:15
Oh my goodness!
1:17
(audience laughs)
1:19
He wants me to hang around or something like that.
1:22
And they invited me to a barbecue.
1:23
I said, no, I can not go.
1:25
(audience laughs)
1:27
My parents, immigrants, came with no money.
1:30
No money, not this welfare thing.
1:31
That's nothing, welfare's luxury, huh?
1:35
It's like I'm on welfare.
1:35
You are rich.
1:37
(audience laughs)
1:39
You know, they came to the airport naked.

They're like, can we get on the plane?
1:44
(audience laughs)
1:45
I don't want to show you where my passport is.
1:47
(audience laughs)
1:49
For real, I can't even compare.
1:54
Go on, laugh it up.
1:56
I can't even compare financial struggles with my father.
1:59
I can go, Dad, I can't get these new Nikes,
2:02
I don't have enough money.
2:04
You don't have enough money for your new Nikes?
2:06
When I was your age
2:08
(audience laughs)
2:09
we didn't have feet.
2:10
(audience laughs)
2:15
It's like, well, I wanna get some Pumas.
2:18
Pumas?
2:19
When I was your age, we had to chase it.
2:21
(audience laughs)
2:22
I'm looking forward to Halloween.
2:25
Man, I love it.
2:26
(audience applauds)
2:28
'Cause I'm big now and I can beat up kids
2:30
and get their candy.
2:31
What?
2:32
'Cause when I was small, I almost died trick or treating.
2:37
I almost died trick or treating, 'cause I had asthma.
2:38
And you know, your parents buy you that cheap mask?
2:40
(audience laughs)
2:41
The cheap plastic one.
2:43
You can barely breathe in it.
2:45
And that band in the back of your head,
2:47
making your bleed through your skull.
2:48
(audience laughs)
2:50
And you know they can't hear you saying trick or treat.
2:51

2:54
Trick or treat.

Trick or treat.

Trick or treat.
3:01
(audience laughs)
3:05
And how much air did they give us in the mask,
3:07
that little slot?
3:11
You stick your tongue through it?
3:13
(audience laughs)
3:14
Trick or treat.
3:17
And then you would cut your tongue,
3:19
'cause that was razor sharp.
3:20
(audience laughs)
3:22
And they say it's that razors and the apples,
3:24
no, it's your mask!
3:25
(audience laughs)
3:27
- I love Alabama football, okay?
3:28

3:30
- Love Alabama football, it don't matter if you're booing.
3:31
It don't matter,
3:32
They're just good players, you must be from a loser school.
3:34
(audience laughs)
3:35
- They were the last to have black players,
3:37
Alabama football.
3:39
And Bear Bryant at the time, he was the coach for Alabama,
3:42
and they were like, I think we need colored players.
3:44
And, and the alumni was like,
3:47
we don't want no goddamn color players,
3:49
he doesn't live here.
3:51
No colored players, goddamn you better not bring
3:53
in no colored players.
3:58
- I'm sure you know what they were saying, right?
3:59
(audience laughs)
4:01
Then one day Alabama was playing a team
4:04
with colored players and this is what they saw.
4:08
(audience laughs)
4:11
What the hell was that?
4:12
(audience laughs)
4:13
That was one of them colored players, coach.
4:16
He's like, yo, let me get the phone,
4:18
yeah, we need some colored players.
4:19
(audience laughs)
4:21
Why?
4:22
'Cause to catch the other colored players, yeah.
4:24
(audience laughs)
4:25
Oh, the white guys just went by, holy shit.

4:44
(audience laughs)
4:46
Especially when the basketball team was away.
4:47
I was the only one left on campus.
4:49
(audience laughs)
4:51
And I was the only black in every class.
4:54
Hard to be absent.
4:55
(audience laughs)
4:59
Where's the little negro boy we put in the middle?
5:01
(audience laughs)
5:03
And it's black history month.
5:05
Yeah, thanks for the shortest month, asses,
5:08
and the coldest, yeah, let's keep it in the winter time,
5:10
'cause their skin gets really ashy.
5:12
They can't really do anything.
5:14
(audience laughs)
5:15
- But I was cool 'cause I posed for the brochure.
5:18
(audience laughs)
5:22
Every college has a minority page.
5:24
I was a black dude standing by the computer.
5:26
(audience laughs)
5:29
Along am my Indian friend, Raji.
5:32
And I like when I see thugs in college.
5:36
Why are you trying to be a thug in college?
5:37
(audience laughs)
5:38
A thug, a thug?
5:40
What, that doesn't even look right.
5:42
It's like, yo, we gonna kick his after my finals.
5:44
(audience laughs)
5:46
I got two labs, I'm gonna kill him right after that.

I used to live in Queens.
5:52
Anyone here from Queens.
5:54
(audience cheers)
5:55
Yeah.
5:56
I used to live right by the bodega.
5:59
You know what the bodega is?
6:00
It's the little Latin store
6:03
and they try to act like it's a grocery store.
6:05
(audience laughs)
6:06
It has two aisles.
6:09
And the guy, he always tries to help me,
6:10
you looking for the bread?
6:11
I was like, dude, I can see it right here, all right?
6:13
(audience laughs)
6:15
We like, hey, hey, it's in aisle two.
6:15
That's all you got.
6:16
What you talking about?
6:19
Every bodega has a cat.
6:21
(audience laughs)
6:23
El Gato.
6:24
(audience laughs)
6:25
This is a Latin cat.
6:27
This isn't that stuff you see on TV.
6:30
No, this is a Latin cat.
6:33
El Gato, been working in the bodega for like 30 years.
6:37
(audience laughs)
6:38
And he wants to kill the Taco Bell dog.
6:40
(audience laughs)
6:42
Don't like him.
6:43
And you know most cats you can scare away, right?
6:45
You see a cat on the street, get outta here!
6:47
Meow.
6:48
Not El Gato.
6:51
I tried to scare El Gato, get outta here!
6:52
He's like, you get outta here.
6:54
(audience laughs)
6:57
Hombre chocolate, I don't like you!
6:59
(audience laughs)
7:00
I'm like, sorry I left you know?
7:02
And I don't know how he got my number,
7:03
I was like, oh my God!
7:05
He was on my caller ID.
7:06
I was like, El Gato?
7:08
(audience laughs)
7:10
I said, hello?
7:11
El Meow.
7:12

7:13
(audience laughs)
7:15
Then he called back like an hour later.
7:16
Hello?
7:17
Sammy Sosa.
7:18

7:19
He knows about baseball.
7:20
Who rides the train here?
7:21
(audience applauds)
7:23
Yeah, it's not cute, it's not cute.
7:27
Those people in the booth?
7:30
That's why that booth is bulletproof.
7:32
(audience laughs)
7:33
They know you're late for a train.
7:35
They know you're late.
7:36
They take their time with your money.
7:38
You've going up to the glass.
7:39
You know how you go to the glass
7:40
and tell 'em hurry up with my metro card,
7:41

(audience laughs)
7:47
And they know, they're like, oh, he's late.
7:50
(audience laughs)
7:51
I'll count his money slowly.
7:53
(audience laughs)
7:55
You like wanna stick your mouth through the slot.
7:56
What are you doing with my money?
7:59
Give me my Metro Card!
8:01
(audience laughs)
8:05
Then you run, gotta catch a train.
8:09
Catching a train is something, huh?
8:11
Yeah, it's an accomplishment.
8:13
It's not a joke.
8:15
Especially when you gotta go down the stair,
8:17
the two stair, not just one.
8:19
I'm talking about two stair like,
8:21
(audience laughs)
8:23
and you never have the right clothes on.
8:24
It's not like you have the Nike chase the train shoes on.
8:27
You always got something weird like a bag and a cake.
8:29
You always gotta.
8:30
(audience laughs)
8:33
And there's and there's always the old person.
8:36

9:07
You don't just get on hey, no,
9:09

9:11
in the Olympics.
9:12
(audience laughs)
9:17
(audience applauds)
9:26
And you don't sit down right away.
9:28
You gotta let everybody know you caught it.
9:30
(audience laughs)
9:38
I think I'll start stretching out.
9:40

9:42
knocked down an old man and the whole thing,
9:43

9:44
(audience laughs)
9:45
Then you start feeling stupid
9:46
'cause the train hasn't moved yet.
9:48
(audience laughs)
9:56
Then you hear that announcement?
9:57
This train is not in service.
