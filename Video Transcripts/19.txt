WHOO!
0:29
ALL RIGHT, WHOO!
0:31
THAT IS WHAT I LIKE TO HEAR. THAT IS THE LADY CHEER.
0:34
"WHOO!"
0:35
SOUNDS LIKE MORE OF A MATING CALL AT THIS POINT.
0:37
"WHOO!" IT'S THE GIRL CHEER.
0:39
IT'S WHAT GIRLS DO TO LET YOU KNOW
0:40
WE'RE HERE, WE'RE READY TO GO.
0:42
YOU HAVING FUN? [ SHRIEKS ]
0:44
[ LAUGHTER ]
0:46
HAPPY TO BE HERE? [ SHRIEKS ]
0:49
WHERE'D YOU GO TO SCHOOL?
0:51
[ Squeaky voice ] USC, HOME OF THE TROJANS.
0:52
WHOO!
0:53
[ LAUGHTER ]
0:54
[ Normal voice ] IT'S LIKE,
0:55
"MA'AM, THIS IS A JOB INTERVIEW.
0:59
WHY DON'T YOU PUT YOUR SHIRT DOWN?"
1:02
[ LAUGHTER ]
1:03
I'M SO EXCITED.
1:04
I LOVE NEW YORK CITY. I LOVE BEING HERE.
1:06
AND I LOVE THAT IT'S COLD HERE -- THAT, TOO.
1:09
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
1:11
OH, AND...
1:14
CONGRATULATIONS ON YOUR YANKEES.
1:15
GOOD FOR YOU, GUYS.
1:17
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
1:22
I LOVE THAT IT'S COLD HERE. I LOVE -- I LOVE SEASON CHANGES.
1:24
ONE OF MY BIGGEST PET PEEVES, THOUGH,
1:26
IS PEOPLE WHO ACT LIKE,
1:27
BECAUSE THEY'RE FROM SOMEWHERE COLD,
1:29
THAT THEY DON'T GET COLD.
1:32
[ LAUGHTER ]
1:33
I WAS IN NEW YORK LAST CHRISTMAS.
1:35
IT'S SNOWING. THERE'S A GUY IN A T-SHIRT.
1:36
I'M LIKE, "DUDE, AREN'T YOU COLD?"
1:38
[ New York accent ] "NO, I'M FROM NEW YORK. I DON'T GET COLD."
1:40
[ LAUGHTER ]
1:41
[ Normal voice ] JUST 'CAUSE YOU'RE FROM A COLD PLACE
1:43
DOESN'T MEAN YOU'RE GENETICALLY PREDISPOSED TO NOT FEELING COLD.
1:47
YOU'RE NOT A PENGUIN.
1:49
I WAS LIKE, "IN FACT, SIR, YOU'RE PUERTO RICAN,
1:51
SO, IF ANYTHING, YOU SHOULD BE MORE COLD."
1:54
[ LAUGHTER ]
1:55
I LIKE LOOKING AT PEOPLE WITH TATTOOS AND JUST ASKING...
1:59
"Why?"
2:01
PEOPLE GET, LIKE, THE WEIRDEST ONES.
2:03
I SAW A WOMAN AT THE FAIR, ALL RIGHT?
2:05
SHE WAS...A HANDSOME WOMAN.
2:06
WE'LL LEAVE IT AT THAT.
2:08
SHE WAS -- SHE WAS A BIGGER --
2:09
SHE MUST'VE BEEN LIKE A LINEBACKER IN MIDDLE SCHOOL.
2:11
I SAY MIDDLE SCHOOL
2:13
'CAUSE THERE'S NO WAY SHE WENT TO HIGH SCHOOL.
2:15
THIS WOMAN...
2:16
[ LAUGHTER ]
2:18
...SHE HAD ANGEL WINGS, LITTLE ONES,
2:20
AND I DON'T KNOW IF THEY STARTED OUT NORMAL AND SHE GOT BIGGER
2:22
OR IF THEY WERE MEANT TO BE LITTLE -- I DON'T KNOW.
2:24
IT HAPPENS WITH TATTOOS.
2:26
SHE HAD LITTLE ANGEL WINGS TATTOOED RIGHT HERE
2:28
ON HER SHOULDER BLADES, OKAY?
2:30
AND I'VE SEEN THIS TATTOO ON A LOT OF GIRLS.
2:32
AND WHENEVER I SEE, LIKE, A BIG WOMAN WITH ANGEL WINGS,
2:35
IT'S KIND OF LIKE LOOKING AT A PENGUIN.
2:37
[ LAUGHTER ]
2:39
'CAUSE I'M SITTING THERE STARING AT HER, BAFFLED, JUST LIKE,
2:42
"HOW ARE THOSE LITTLE WINGS GONNA LIFT THAT BIG BODY?"
2:45
[ LAUGHTER ]
2:47
[ APPLAUSE ]
2:52
GUESS YOU'RE STAYING HERE.
2:54
GUYS LIKE TO GET THE BARBED WIRE.
2:57
WHAT DOES THAT SAY?
2:58
[ Deep voice ] "I'M BARBED WIRE. I'M A BADASS."
3:00
[ Normal voice ] WHY JUST ON THE ONE ARM?
3:02
IS THAT WARNING ME ABOUT THE DANGERS OF THAT ARM?
3:04
[ Deep voice ] "I WARNED YOU.
3:06
"I COULD BE AT A BUS STOP. THIS ARM'S FINE.
3:08
"THIS ONE COULD -- PFFT! -- GET YOU IN THE TOOTH.
3:09
"WE DON'T KNOW.
3:10
DON'T KNOW WHAT IT'LL DO. YOU'VE BEEN WARNED."
3:12
[ Normal voice ] THIS GUY HAD BARBED WIRE HERE,
3:14
BUT IT DIDN'T COMPLETE ON THE INSIDE.
3:17
WHAT THAT SAYS TO ME IS,
3:19
"I'M A BADASS IF YOU'RE LOOKING BUT NOT IF IT'S OWIE."
3:21
[ LAUGHTER ]
3:24
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
3:27
I LIKE TO STAY IN. I DON'T GO OUT MUCH.
3:29
I LIKE TO STAY IN AND LISTEN TO MUSIC.
3:31
I LOVE RAP MUSIC.
3:32
I LOVE HIP-HOP. I LOVE RAP.
3:34
SPECIFICALLY, I LIKE THE RADIO.
3:35
I LIKE TO LISTEN RAP ON THE RADIO.
3:37
I GET WEIRDED OUT WHEN PEOPLE DON'T LIKE THE RADIO,
3:40
LIKE, "NO, IT'S TOO COMMERCIAL, TOO CORPORATE.
3:42
"I ONLY LISTEN TO MY OWN HOMEMADE MIX TAPES
3:44
OF MORRISSEY AND RAINFOREST NOISES."
3:46
PBHT!
3:48
[ LAUGHTER ]
3:49
LOVE THE RADIO, LOVE HIP-HOP, LOVE THE RADIO AND HIP-HOP.
3:53
I CANNOT STAND HIP-HOP-STATION DEEJAYS.
3:56
I THINK THEY ARE SOME OF THE MOST IRRITATING PEOPLE
3:59
ON THE PLANET, OKAY?
4:01
THEY ARE INCAPABLE OF SAYING ANYTHING TO YOU
4:04
IN ANY VOICE OTHER THAN A YELL.
4:06
IT DOESN'T MATTER IF THE COMMERCIAL
4:08
IS FOR A CAR DEALERSHIP, A WEIGHT-LOSS CENTER,
4:10
A CARPET-CLEANING PLACE, IT SOUNDS LIKE THIS.
4:13
"HEY! HEY!
4:14
"Y'ALL [BLEEP] TO GET YOUR WEIGHT LOSS ON!
4:17
Y'ALL WANT TO TAKE YOUR WEIGHT LOSS TO THE NEXT LEVEL?!"
4:20
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
4:27
"Y'ALL WANT TO TAKE YOUR WEIGHT LOSS TO THE NEXT LEVEL,
4:30
"GET YOURSELF DOWN TO THE CALIFORNIA HEALTH CLINIC
4:32
"ON THE REAL, YO!
4:33
"HEY, BEING OVERWEIGHT, THAT CAN LEAD TO DIABETES,
4:35
"HEART FAILURE, YO, EVEN SUDDEN DEATH,
4:37
AND Y'ALL DON'T WANT TO GO OUT LIKE THAT!"
4:41
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
4:45
"GO OUT LIKE THAT"?
4:46
THAT'S KIND OF A CAVALIER WAY TO TALK ABOUT DYING,
4:49
DON'T YOU THINK, D.J...CASH MONEY?
4:51
THAT'S THE WAY YOU TALK ABOUT BASKET--
4:53
"OH, I GOT SHUT OUT IN BASKETBALL 85-0 --
4:55
DIDN'T WANT TO GO OUT LIKE THAT."
4:56
FINE.
4:58
"OH, I WENT TO JAIL 'CAUSE I HAD ONE BEER OPEN IN MY CAR
5:00
WHILE I WAS DRIVING -- DIDN'T WANT TO GO OUT LIKE THAT."
5:02
OKAY.
5:03
BUT DYING FROM MAJOR HEART COMPLICATIONS
5:05
DUE TO EARLY ONSET DIABETES,
5:06
YOU'LL PARDON ME IF I DON'T WANT TO TAKE MY MEDICAL ADVICE
5:09
FROM SOME DEEJAY THAT JUST GOT DONE
5:11
JUDGING A THICK-LEG CONTEST
5:12
WHILE WEARING A BEDAZZLED BARACK OBAMA SHIRT -- PASS.
5:16
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
5:23
LET ME ASK YOU FOLKS A QUESTION.
5:25
YOU EVER CATCH A TABLE CORNER IN THE CROTCH
5:27
WHEN YOU'RE WALKING TOO FAST?
5:29
IT HAPPENS. YOU CAN'T PREDICT IT.
5:32
IT'S LIKE A SNAKE IN THE GRASS. IT JUST -- "YAH!"
5:35
NABS YA.
5:37
I ALWAYS WEAR A PLASTIC INSERT HERE
5:40
SO AS TO DEFLECT ONCOMING TABLE CORNERS.
5:43
IT'S A HORRIBLE PAIN.
5:45
YOU GUYS WALK INTO A RESTAURANT --
5:47
YOU GUYS WALK INTO A RESTAURANT, YOU SEE TABLES.
5:49
I SEE A MINEFIELD.
5:51
'CAUSE IT COMES OUT OF NOWHERE. YOU'RE JUST WALKING.
5:53
[ Squeaky voice ] "THIS IS SO MUCH FUN.
5:55
"I THINK WE SHOULD GET THE PUDDING.
5:56
"UGH!
5:57
I'M OKAY."
5:59
[ GAGS ]
6:01
[ LAUGHTER ]
6:05
[ Normal voice ] THERE ARE TWO WAYS TO RECOVER...
6:08
FROM GETTING NAILED IN THE CROTCH WITH A TABLE CORNER.
6:11
THAT'S WHY I'M HERE TONIGHT -- TO SHARE THIS WITH YOU.
6:14
THE FIRST IS A PICK-AND-ROLL.
6:16
[ LIGHT LAUGHTER ]
6:18
THAT'S WHERE YOU JUST
6:19
TAKE THAT TABLE CORNER LIKE A [BLEEP] CHAMP.
6:22
[ LAUGHTER ]
6:24
DON'T LET IT AFFECT YOU.
6:25
THIS LEG STAYS PLANTED. YOU CAN PIVOT AROUND IT.
6:28
[ LAUGHTER ]
6:29
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
6:32
[ LAUGHS ]
6:37
BUT DO NOT LIFT THIS LEG, OR ELSE IT'S TRAVELING.
6:39
YOU'RE GONNA GET A TECHNICAL.
6:41
I'LL SHOW YOU WHAT IT WOULD LOOK LIKE, ALL RIGHT?
6:43
[ Squeaky voice ] "THIS IS SO MUCH FUN.
6:44
"I THINK I'M JUST GONNA GET THE CHEESE.
6:46
"I DON'T WANT ANY CARBS. I'M GONNA WEAR A BATHING SUIT.
6:47
NO CARBS. I'M OKAY."
6:49
[ LAUGHTER ]
6:57
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
7:04
[ Normal voice ] STICK THE LANDING.
7:07
NOW, BEAR IN MIND, YOUR DATE JUST SAW YOU EAT CRAP,
7:10
SO YOU BETTER, LIKE, EXPLAIN THAT ONE.
7:11
[ Squeaky voice] "WHAT? I DIDN'T FALL.
7:14
"I WAS TWIRLING.
7:15
I SAW CHEESECAKE. I TWIRLED. GET ME A DIET SODA!"
7:18
[ LAUGHTER ]
7:20
[ Normal voice ] THERE'S NO GRACEFUL WAY TO GET UP FROM THAT.
7:23
THAT'S IT.
7:24
OR YOU CAN JUST DO WHAT I DID.
7:26
MY DATE TOLD ME THAT I LOOKED LIKE A DINOSAUR
7:28
GETTING HIT WITH A ROCK...
7:30
WHEN I GOT NAILED IN THE CROTCH WITH A TABLE CORNER.
7:33
WE WERE OUT ON OUR DATE -- OUR LAST DATE.
7:36
[ LAUGHTER ]
7:37
I WAS PROBABLY MAKING GOOGLY EYES AT THE WAITER OR SOMETHING.
7:39
[ Squeaky voice ] "THIS IS SO FUN.
7:41
"I'M NOT GONNA HAVE ANYTHING. I'M JUST GETTING WATER.
7:42
"I'LL DRINK LATER -- HAVE A MARGARITA.
7:43
EEE!"
7:45
[ LAUGHTER ]
7:50
[ SCREECHES ]
7:52
[ SCREECHES ]
7:54
[ APPLAUSE ]
7:57
[ SCREECHES ]
8:05
[ Normal voice ] THAT WAS ME EATING A LOW-FLYING PTERODACTYL.
8:08
[ LAUGHTER ]
8:09
ONCE YOU'VE FALLEN ON A DATE,
8:12
THERE'S PRETTY MUCH NOWHERE TO GO FROM HERE BUT DOWN.
8:15
IT'S A SHARP PAIN, TOO,
8:16
SO YOUR VOMIT COMES UP TO HERE IN YOUR THROAT.
8:19
GET THAT INVOLUNTARY TRAIL OF TEARS --
8:21
NOT A NATIVE-AMERICAN REFERENCE.
8:23
THAT'S JUST WHAT HAPPENS.
8:24
[ LAUGHTER ]
8:27
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
8:31
GOING OUT, ALSO, YOU GOT TO DRESS UP
8:33
IF YOU'RE GONNA GO OUT --
8:35
TEDIOUS, POINTLESS.
8:36
GUYS, NEXT TIME YOU SEE A GIRL IN A PAIR OF HEELS,
8:39
ASK HER HOW TALL SHE IS.
8:41
SHE WILL GIVE YOU TWO NUMBERS.
8:43
SHE WILL GIVE YOU HER HEIGHT...
8:44
[ Squeaky voice ] AND HER HEEL HEIGHT.
8:46
[ Normal voice ] "HOW TALL ARE YOU?"
8:47
[ Squeaky voice ] "I'M 5'6". I'M 5'9" IN HEELS."
8:49
[ Normal voice ] GIRLS, DON'T DO THAT.
8:51
NO ONE'S INTERESTED IN HOW TALL YOU CAN BE.
8:53
WE'RE NOT PICKING FOR BASKETBALL TEAMS.
8:55
IT DOESN'T MATTER.
8:56
THEY'RE JUST TRYING TO TALK TO YOU.
8:57
AFTER THAT INITIAL HEIGHT,
8:59
IT'S JUST MINDLESS STATEMENTS AFTER THAT.
9:01
5'6", 5'9" IN HEELS -- GREAT.
9:02
I CAN GO 5 MILES AN HOUR, 80 IN A CAR.
9:05
[ LAUGHTER ]
9:06
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
9:12
MEN ARE HUNTERS. WOMEN ARE GATHERERS.
9:16
THESE ARE YOUR SOCIETAL ROLES AS DICTATED BY NATURE.
9:19
MEN ARE HUNTERS. WOMEN ARE GATHERERS.
9:21
EXCEPT FOR WHEN IT COMES TO SHOPPING.
9:23
[ LAUGHTER ]
9:25
AND THEN WOMEN ARE HUNTERS.
9:27
BUT WE ARE THE ONLY CREATURES
9:29
THAT WILL RATIONALIZE A KILL AFTER WE MAKE IT.
9:32
[ LAUGHTER ]
9:33
A LION RUNS DOWN A TURKEY, EATS IT, DOESN'T THINK TWICE ABOUT IT,
9:36
ALTHOUGH WHY A LION AND A TURKEY ARE ON THE SAME TERRAIN, I DON'T KNOW.
9:39
THIS IS A -- WOULDN'T MATTER.
9:41
NO WOMAN'S EVER JUST SWIPED A CREDIT CARD
9:42
AND BEEN LIKE [EXHALES SHARPLY]
9:44
[ Squeaky voice ] "SUPER CONFIDENT WITH MYSELF AND THAT CHOICE.
9:45
I'M JUST GONNA GO."
9:47
[ Normal voice ] NO! THERE...
9:49
[ LAUGHTER ]
9:51
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
9:54
LADIES...
9:56
THERE IS A FULL-ON DEBATE BETWEEN THAT GIRL
9:59
AND WHATEVER POOR SOUL SHE DRAGGED WITH HER THAT DAY
10:02
TO THE MALL.
10:03
IT'S LIKE [EXHALES SHARPLY]
10:05
[ Squeaky voice ] "WAS THAT A GOOD IDEA?"
10:06
"THOSE SHOES ARE SUPER CUTE." "DO YOU LIKE THEM?"
10:08
"I REALLY LIKE THEM." "ARE YOU SURE YOU LIKE THEM?"
10:09
[ Normal voice ] "JUST GET THE [BLEEP] SHOES!
10:11
"WE'VE BEEN HERE FOR FIVE [BLEEP] HOURS!
10:13
I WANT TO GO HOME TO MY FAMILY!"
10:14
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
10:21
GUYS DON'T DO THAT. IT'S NOT LIKE...
10:23
[ Deep voice ] "I WENT BEAR HUNTING LAST WEEK.
10:24
"I KILLED A BEAR.
10:26
BUT I DON'T KNOW HOW I FEEL ABOUT IT."
10:28
[ LAUGHTER ]
10:29
[ Normal voice ] HIS FRIEND DOESN'T SWOOP IN LIKE,
10:32
"YOU KNOW WHY IT'S GOOD YOU WENT?
10:34
YOU GOT TO SPEND SOME TIME OUTDOORS."
10:36
[ LAUGHTER ]
10:38
"YOU GOT TO HANG OUT WITH YOUR DAD."
10:41
[ LAUGHTER ]
10:44
"NOW YOU HAVE A BEAR."
10:45
[ LAUGHTER ]
10:46
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
10:56
I'VE COME UP WITH A COUPLE OF MINOR PHYSICAL INDICATORS
10:59
THAT YOU CAN LOOK FOR IN PEOPLE
11:01
THAT WILL TELL YOU, "OH, THIS PERSON'S A CRAZY PERSON."
11:03
A COUPLE OF PHYSICAL THINGS YOU CAN LOOK FOR THAT WILL TELL YOU,
11:06
"OH, MAYBE I SHOULD AVOID THIS PERSON
11:07
DURING THE HOLIDAY SEASON."
11:09
OKAY?
11:11
SO, FIRST ONE -- THE NEXT TIME YOU SMILE AT SOMEONE
11:14
AND THEY SMILE BACK AT YOU,
11:16
LOOK AND SEE IF THEY'RE MISSING...
11:19
THIS TOOTH.
11:21
[ LAUGHTER ]
11:25
THOSE OF YOU NOT LAUGHING ARE MISSING THIS TOOTH.
11:29
[ LAUGHTER ]
11:31
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT'S WRONG WITH IT.
11:33
WHEN YOU'RE MISSING YOUR TWO FRONT TEETH, THAT'S HONESTY.
11:37
THAT IS A DOOR TO YOUR ORAL HISTORY.
11:38
YOU'RE NOT COVERING ANYTHING UP.
11:40
YOU'RE SAYING, "HEY, WORLD, I'M MISSING MY FRONT TEETH.
11:42
"I'M GROSS, I'M DIRTY, I'M POOR.
11:43
"I CLEARLY HAVE NO PROBLEM
11:44
"WITH PUBLIC URINATION AND EATING GARBAGE.
11:46
DON'T COME NEAR ME. I'LL GUM YOU TO DEATH."
11:48
BLAH, BLAH!
11:50
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
11:52
RIGHT?
11:53
YOU CAN GO BACK TO EATING YOUR CAT SANDWICH --
11:55
WHATEVER YOU'RE DOING.
11:58
WHEN YOU HAVE YOUR FRONT TEETH
12:00
BUT YOU'RE MISSING THE CREEPY SIDE TOOTH...
12:03
THAT'S A LITTLE DIFFERENT,
12:05
'CAUSE WHAT THAT SAYS TO THE WORLD IS...
12:07
"OH, I HAVE MY FRONT TEETH."
12:10
[ LAUGHTER ]
12:15
"SO, AT SOME POINT IN MY LIFE,
12:18
"I HAD THE MENTAL AWARENESS AND DENTAL PROWESS...
12:22
"TO TAKE CARE OF MY FRONT TEETH,
12:24
"MY 'WORK TEETH'...
12:27
"MY 'SHOWING TEETH'...
12:30
"MY CHURCH TEETH.
12:31
"BUT SOMEWHERE ALONG THE LINE,
12:34
"I LOST MY [BLEEP] MARBLES, AND I REASONED, 'YOU KNOW WHAT?
12:36
"'I DON'T THINK I NEED THIS TOOTH.
12:37
"'I'LL LET IT FALL OUT AND MAKE EATING A LOT MORE BREEZY.
12:40
"'MAYBE PUT A PIECE OF CORN UP IN THERE.
12:41
"'MAYBE I GOT A NEW YELLOW TOOTH. I DON'T NEED ANY TEETH.
12:43
"'I'LL SPEND MY DENTIST MONEY
12:45
"ON A SCRATCH-OFF TICKET AND SOME BEEF JERKY.'
12:46
MAH!"
12:48
[ LAUGHTER ]
12:49
[ APPLAUSE ]
12:56
SAME KIND OF WOMEN THAT ARE MISSING THAT TOOTH
12:58
ARE THE SAME KIND OF WOMEN THAT GROW THEIR HAIR TOO LONG.
13:01
[ LAUGHTER ]
13:02
JUST BE CAREFUL, OKAY?
13:04
LOOKING AROUND, I SEE A LOT OF VERY HYGIENIC LENGTHS.
13:06
THAT'S GOOD. YOU ALL LOOK VERY CLEAN, VERY NICE.
13:08
GIRLS, GROW YOUR HAIR LONG. THAT'S FINE.
13:10
MEN LOVE IT WHEN WOMEN HAVE LONG HAIR, RIGHT?
13:13
MEN LOVE IT WHEN WOMEN LOOK LIKE WHAT?
13:15
HORSES -- EXACTLY. GROW YOUR HAIR LONG.
13:17
[ LAUGHTER ]
13:19
BUT, LADIES, JUST KNOW THAT WHEN YOU GROW YOUR HAIR TOO LONG,
13:23
YOU GOT ABOUT 2 INCHES' DIFFERENCE
13:25
BETWEEN REALLY HOT, SEXY SUPERMODEL...
13:30
RELIGIOUS FANATIC.
13:32
[ LAUGHTER ]
13:33
[ APPLAUSE ]
13:36
HOT MAXIM COVER GIRL
13:38
THAT EVERYBODY WANTS TO MOUTH-KISS...
13:40
UNHEALTHY FAITH IN YOUR LORD.
13:42
[ LAUGHTER ]
13:44
SOFT, SILKY, SHINY HAIR EVERYONE WANTS TO TOUCH...
13:47
ONE OF 12 BRIDES.
13:49
SO...
13:50
[ LAUGHTER ]
13:53
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
13:59
I'M JUST SAYING KEEP YOUR HAIR TRIMMED
14:02
SO THAT PEOPLE DON'T THINK YOU LIVE ON A COMPOUND
14:04
AND MAKE YOUR OWN SHOES.
14:05
THAT'S ALL I'M SAYING IS DO THAT.
14:07
I HAVE A GIFT FOR THE GIRLS IN THE AUDIENCE.
14:10
I THINK SOMETIMES, AS WOMEN,
14:12
WE FEEL THAT THERE ARE A LOT OF SOCIETAL PRESSURES ON US, RIGHT?
14:15
THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS TO DO, A LOT OF THINGS TO CONSIDER.
14:18
FROM THE SECOND YOU WAKE UP, AS A GIRL,
14:19
THE SECOND YOU WAKE UP IN THE MORNING,
14:21
YOUR MIND IS INUNDATED WITH A BILLION QUESTIONS
14:23
ON HOW TO PROCEED WITH YOUR DAY.
14:24
YOU OPEN YOUR EYES, AND IT'S, "OH, MY GOD.
14:26
"AM I FAT? AM I THIN? SHOULD I WORK OUT?
14:27
"SHOULD I HAVE BREAKFAST? SHOULD I SKIP BREAKFAST?
14:29
"SHOULD I GO TO LUNCH? SHOULD I CALL MY MOM?
14:30
"SHOULD I CALL MY DAD? SHOULD I MySpace?
14:31
"SHOULD I FACEBOOK? SHOULD I TWITTER?
14:32
"SHOULD I DO YOGA? SHOULD I DO PILATES?
14:33
"SHOULD I GET A FRIEND? SHOULD I GET A BOYFRIEND?
14:35
"SHOULD I GET A GIRLFRIEND? SHOULD I GET A DOG?
14:36
"SHOULD I GET A CAT? SHOULD I GET 12 CATS?
14:37
SHOULD I CALL MY FRIENDS? WHAT SHOULD I DO? OH, MY GOD."
14:39
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
14:40
SO MANY QUESTIONS.
14:45
WOULDN'T IT BE GREAT
14:46
IF I COULD ANSWER ONE OF THOSE QUESTIONS DEFINITIVELY
14:48
AND YOU'D HAVE THAT GEM OF KNOWLEDGE?
14:50
ANSWER ONE OF THESE QUESTIONS,
14:52
YOU COULD PLAN THE REST OF YOUR LIFE AROUND THAT TRUTH.
14:54
ALL RIGHT? SO I FIGURED OUT THE ANSWER.
14:56
I FIGURED OUT THE WAY TO ANSWER A VERY DIFFICULT QUESTION.
14:59
I FIGURED OUT A WAY TO TELL WHETHER YOU'RE HOT OR NOT.
15:02
[ LAUGHTER ]
15:04
EMPIRICALLY. SO HERE'S WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO.
15:07
THE NEXT TIME YOU'RE OUT WHEREVER YOU GO TO MEET BOYS --
15:10
ALL RIGHT? -- A BAR, A CLUB,
15:12
LITTLE CAESARS, WHATEVER YOU LIKE TO DO...
15:14
AND YOU SEE A GUY THAT YOU THINK IS HOT,
15:18
GO UP TO HIM
15:20
AND PUNCH HIM IN THE FACE.
15:22
IF YOU'RE HOT, HE'LL BE LIKE,
15:23
"THAT WAS REALLY CUTE. WHY'D YOU PUNCH ME?
15:26
"IT WAS SO ADORABLE. THAT DIDN'T HURT.
15:27
"COME BACK. LET ME SHOW YOU HOW TO PUNCH.
15:29
"DON'T PUT YOUR THUMB IN -- YOU'RE GONNA BREAK IT.
15:31
"COME HERE. LET ME SHOW YOU.
15:32
"COME HERE. WHERE YOU GOING?
15:34
"DON'T RUN AWAY. COME HERE. COME HERE.
15:36
"LET ME CUP YOUR BOOB UNCOMFORTABLY
15:38
WHILE I SHOW YOU THIS."
15:39
IF YOU'RE UGLY, BOOM, HE'S KNOCKING YOU OUT
15:42
'CAUSE NO GUY'S GONNA TAKE THAT FROM AN UGLY CHICK.
15:45
THAT'S YOUR BAROMETER.
15:47
[ APPLAUSE ]
15:53
LADIES, LADIES...
15:55
YOU MIGHT LOSE A TOOTH.
15:57
[ LAUGHTER ]
15:59
BUT WHEN YOU COME OUT OF THAT COMA,
16:01
YOU'LL KNOW.
16:04
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
16:10
I THINK THERE ARE CERTAIN RULES IN LIFE
16:12
THAT WE BLINDLY FOLLOW AND NEVER QUESTION.
16:14
I WAS GETTING DRESSED THE OTHER DAY, AND I ASKED MY FRIEND --
16:17
I SAID, "WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THIS OUTFIT?"
16:18
AND HER RESPONSE WAS, "WHY DO YOU CARE WHAT PEOPLE THINK?"
16:21
AND MY RESPONSE WAS, "I'M SORRY,
16:23
WHY DON'T YOU CARE WHAT PEOPLE THINK?"
16:25
IT'S THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IN THE WORLD.
16:28
NEXT TO BRUSHING YOUR TEETH,
16:29
IT'S PROBABLY THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IN THE WORLD.
16:32
I WOULD TAKE THESE THREE PEOPLE LIKING ME
16:34
OVER FREE HEALTH INSURANCE IN A HEARTBEAT.
16:36
WHAT'S THE POINT OF LIVING A LONG TIME
16:38
IF PEOPLE THINK YOU'RE AN [BLEEP]
16:40
NO POINT.
16:41
YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENED THE LAST TIME A GROUP OF PEOPLE SAID,
16:43
"SCREW IT, WE DON'T CARE WHAT YOU THINK"?
16:45
THEY GOT HUNG AS WITCHES.
16:47
[ LAUGHTER ]
16:50
ANOTHER ONE -- AND THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT RULE.
16:53
IF I SAY ANYTHING YOU'RE GONNA LISTEN TO TONIGHT,
16:55
THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT ONE.
16:56
YOU CAN TAKE THIS WITH YOU THIS EVENING.
16:58
NEVER LAUGH AT YOUR SIGNIFICANT OTHER...
17:04
...WHEN THEY'RE HAVING AN ORGASM.
17:06
[ LAUGHTER ]
17:08
THAT IS THEIR TIME TO SHINE.
17:11
LET THEM HAVE THAT.
17:13
WHICH BRINGS ME TO MY NEXT POINT.
17:15
I HAVE A POINT OF CONTENTION
17:17
WITH A VERY SPECIFIC SEXUAL POSITION.
17:18
I'M GONNA ASK YOU A QUESTION.
17:20
WHAT IS THE NAME OF THE SEXUAL POSITION
17:22
WHERE THE FEMALE IS BENT OVER FACING OUT
17:24
AND THE MALE IS BEHIND HER?
17:25
DOGGY STYLE.
17:25
DOGGY STYLE.
17:25
DOGGY STYLE.
17:27
VERY GOOD, NEW YORK.
17:29
AND I DID THAT JOKE IN TENNESSEE,
17:31
AND THE GUY'S ANSWER WAS, "UH, MANDATORY."
17:34
[ LAUGHTER ]
17:38
AND WHILE HE'S NOT INCORRECT, IT'S NOT PART OF THE JOKE.
17:41
SO HERE'S MY PROBLEM WITH IT.
17:43
CALLING IT "DOGGY STYLE"
17:45
MAKES IT SOUND LIKE ONLY DOGS ENJOY THIS POSITION,
17:47
AND THAT'S NOT TRUE.
17:49
ALL ANIMALS HAVE SEX IN THIS FASHION.
17:51
[ LIGHT APPLAUSE ]
17:51
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU KNOW -- ALL ANIMALS HAVE SEX
17:53
WITH THE FEMALE BENT OVER FACING OUT.
17:55
WHO'S CLAPPING FOR THAT?
17:55
[ LAUGHTER ]
17:57
ALL ANIMALS HAVE SEX WITH THE FEMALE BENT OVER FACING OUT
18:02
AND THE MALE BEHIND HER.
18:03
HUMAN BEINGS ARE THE ONLY CREATURES
18:05
THAT MAKE LOVE FACING ONE ANOTHER, OKAY?
18:08
ALL ANIMALS HAVE SEX THAT WAY. THINK ABOUT IT.
18:10
YOU'VE NEVER SEEN TWO GOATS, EYES LOCKED, LIKE...
18:12
[ BLEATS ]
18:15
[ LAUGHTER, APPLAUSE ]
18:22
[ BLEATS ]
18:24
[ LAUGHTER ]
18:26
NEVER SEEN TWO COWS IN THEIR LITTLE COW BED,
18:28
LOOKING AT EACH OTHER, HAVING SEX LIKE...
18:29
[ MOOS ]
18:37
MOO. LOVE YOU.
18:41
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
18:44
[ LAUGHS ]
18:47
IT'S GROSS.
18:49
FOR THE GUY, FROM THE DATA I'VE COLLECTED,
18:52
IT SEEMS THAT IT'S EASIER FOR HIM, OKAY?
18:54
SO FOR THE GIRL --
18:55
PRETEND THERE'S SOME SEX GOING ON UP HERE, OKAY?
18:58
THE GIRL, SHE'S BENT OVER TEXTING,
18:59
WHATEVER WE DO DURING SEX.
19:00
"L.O.L." ALL RIGHT? SHE'S BACK HERE.
19:03
THE GUY -- IT'S -- YOU'VE GOT STABILITY.
19:05
THIS IS AN EASY POSITION.
19:06
THE GIRL'S DOWN HERE IN A RIGHT ANGLE,
19:08
WHICH IS ONLY COMFORTABLE FOR...SQUARES.
19:10
I DON'T KNOW.
19:11
[ LAUGHTER ]
19:13
IT'S EASIER, RIGHT?
19:14
AS THE GUY, YOU'VE GOT YOUR STABILITY.
19:17
YOU'VE GOT YOUR CENTER OF GRAVITY.
19:19
YOU'VE GOT YOUR MIRRORS SET UP, EVEN THOUGH I ASKED YOU NOT TO.
19:22
[ LAUGHTER ]
19:24
RIGHT?
19:27
FOR THE GIRL,
19:29
NEVER MIND THE PHYSICAL STRESS
19:31
THAT COMES ALONG WITH THIS POSITION.
19:33
A LOT OF CORE WORK, RIGHT, LADIES?
19:35
VERY ENGAGED, ALL MUSCLES TIGHT.
19:37
THANK GOD YOU TOOK THOSE PILATES CLASSES
19:40
HE GAVE YOU FOR CHRISTMAS, RIGHT?
19:43
DOESN'T COMPARE TO THE MENTAL STRESS
19:45
OF HAVING TO WATCH YOURSELF GET VIOLATED
19:47
IN THIS FUN HOUSE OF MIRRORS HE'S GOT SET UP.
19:50
'CAUSE HERE'S THE DEAL, NEW YORK --
19:53
I DON'T CARE IF YOU'RE BIG, FAT, THIN, SMALL, OLD, YOUNG.
19:56
IT DOES NOT MATTER.
19:57
WHEN YOU ARE PARALLEL TO THE GRAVITATIONAL PULL OF THE EARTH,
20:00
GRAVITY COMES INTO PLAY.
20:03
THEY LOOK LIKE UDDERS.
20:06
[ LAUGHTER, APPLAUSE ]
20:12
HE'S BACK THERE. HE'S LIKE, "SAY MY NAME."
20:14
YOU'RE LIKE...
20:16
[ MOOS ]
20:18
YOU GUYS ARE FANTASTIC. THANK YOU SO MUCH.
