No, thank you. It's not a woo birthday.
0:06
30 is just one of those, I feel like you turn 30,
0:08
and young people are like, "Eh, you're old."
0:10
And old people are like,
0:11
"You don't know what the fuck old is!"
0:12
You're like, "Okay, all right?"
0:15
"I will just sit here in the corner
0:18
'cause standing is starting to hurt my back."
0:20
Like that's what 30 is. (audience laughs)
0:25
It's a weird age, I don't know. I feel like I'm at 30.
0:27
I feel like I just have this now irresistible hankering
0:30
to acquire real estate.
0:32
Like that's just driving around, looking at houses.
0:35
Like, "How do I get one of these goddamn things?
0:39
I want a boat, goddamn it. (audience laughs)
0:42
What do I need to do to get one of these?"
0:45
And I know it's not just me
0:46
'cause all my friends in this age bracket,
0:48
I used to sneak up on 'em in their computers.
0:49
They'd be looking at porn.
0:52
Now it's just Zillow, I'm like,
0:55
"What are you doing, you sick fuck?"
0:58
They're like, "What? I wasn't gonna buy it.
1:00
(audience laughs)
1:03
I just wanna know what the market was like in this area."
1:08
All their browser tabs are like, "Hot,
1:10
open Victorians looking to get filled."
1:12
I'm like, "Just calm down, sir.
1:17
Do not touch yourself to crown molding.
1:20
Do not get a full chub to a half bath.
1:23
It's a little thirsty, we can just chill."
1:29
I gotta start making decisions, like do I wanna have kids?
1:33
It's a big one, I don't know.
1:34
I think I do, but I have to be honest,
1:36
it does scare the shit outta me.
1:37
The idea of bringing a human life into this world,
1:41
being with it, caring for it all the time.
1:43
I'm like, "What if I have a kid and it's a dud?
1:46
(audience laughs)
1:49
What if the kid just sucks, and it's not my fault?
1:54
Now I'm hanging out with a loser, 100% of the time?
1:58
I'm not getting invited to parties
2:00
'cause I'm dragging around this fucking narc?
2:05
I got a great group of friends,
2:07
I'm not at the barbecue just 'cause my kid wants
2:09
to do witchcraft in the backyard?
2:11
I don't think so."
2:15
I just want a good, strong, healthy child,
2:18
who bullies the other ones,
2:20
just mashing a kid's face (audience laughs)
2:23
in the dirt, I'm like,
2:24
"It's gonna make money, I'll tell you that.
2:25
What do we got, sales, real estate, finance?
2:27
Get out there."
2:30
Kid's gonna be okay.
2:34
I wanna think my kid will be cool.
2:36
I'm like, "Oh, it'll be a mix of me and my girl, right?
2:38
She's awesome, that's why I picked her.
2:41
I'm lit," you can tell.
2:44
This haircut? Come on, that's a fun guy.
2:46
(audience laughs)
2:48
But that's not how genetics works.
2:50
You get all sorts of weird recessive shit coming
2:52
down the pipeline.
2:54
Kid could end up being a mix of her aunt and my uncle.
2:57
(audience laughs)
2:59
It's a shitty kid, that's nuts.
3:01
I'm like, "Oh my God, it's a dwarf and a pedophile?"
3:05
(audience laughs)
3:10
At least it's a fair fight down there,
3:11
but (audience laughs)
3:14
that's not what the doctor ordered.
3:17
That's not the kid you want. (laughs)
3:23
I wanna think I'll just focus on my kid,
3:24
like I'll make my kid smart, I'll make my kid study,
3:27
I'll make my kid a doctor.
3:29
But look, my kid's not gonna be a doctor.
3:32
(audience laughs)
3:33
I'm not an immigrant.
3:35
(audience laughs)
3:40
I was born here,
3:41
you think my child's gonna have that kind of work ethic?
3:43
There is a 0% chance
3:46
that entitled little shit is doing extra school.
3:49
There's no way! (audience applauds)
3:52
I'm gonna be like, "Hey, do what you love."
3:54
It's gonna be like, "I love coke," and I'll be like, "Ah!
3:57
(audience laughs)
4:00
Are you good at it?"
4:03
"No, my face is always bleeding."
4:06
I'm like, "Well,
4:07
should have hit you like our foreign friends.
4:09
You would've worked harder. (audience laughs)
4:11
No work ethic." (laughs)
4:15
It'd be a weird time to raise kids, I don't know.
4:18
Everything I read about the younger generation,
4:20
it worries me.
4:21
Everything I read is like gen Z's the most depressed,
4:23
anxiety-ridden generation of all time.
4:26
That's concerning to me.
4:28
Then I go on TikTok, they're all just dancing.
4:30
I'm like, "I think they're fine.
4:35
I'm not a psychologist,
4:36
but I've never ripped off spirit fingers at a funeral.
4:38
So something tells me the children are okay."
4:45
Then I listen to gen Z rap once,
4:46
I was like, "The kids are sad, the kids are very sad.
4:48
They need help, they need a lot of help now."
4:53
I'm not an old, lame man.
4:55
I like it, it's good music.
4:57
It's just the subject matter's depressing as shit
4:59
'cause all gen Z rap's just like,
5:01
£ I just popped a zeny £
5:04
£ I wanna kill myself £
5:06
I'm like, "Jesus Christ."
5:09
Whatever happened to good,
5:10
confident hip hop about killing other people?
5:15
That's what I grew up on, that's a good message.
5:19
You say what you want,
5:20
50 Cent fucking believed in himself,
5:22
okay? (audience applauds)
5:28
That man got shot nine times.
5:29
Did he give up? No!
5:32
He was going to get rich or die trying, right?
5:37
Not try dying, all right?
5:39
That's a better message.
5:43
All I'm saying is these kids need to stop doing drugs
5:45
and start selling them, okay?
5:48
Well, I'll tell my kids, "You wanna do coke in this house?
5:50
Flip a couple fucking bags, all right?
5:53
Get out there!
5:56
Grandpapi came to Ellis Island.
5:57
He'd move that pow-pow in the suburbs, all right?
6:00
Get out there.
6:02
Teach you some good lessons," that's just econ, right?
6:05
You just find a rich kid who has a bad relationship
6:08
with his father, start him off on a gateway.
6:11
Start pounding the hard stuff, water it down.
6:13
That's econ. (audience laughs)
6:16
"Your Christmas present this year is fentanyl.
6:18
Get out there!"
6:20
All right, oh hey, it's my community. I do drugs.
6:23
(Joey and audience laughing)
6:32
I don't know, I don't know why the kids are sad.
6:34
I try to think about it.
6:35
I feel like it has to be phones, right?
6:37
I feel like phones make me depressed.
6:39
There's so much on there, I feel like I get apathetic.
6:41
I look at my phone, I'm like, "I've got texts,
6:42
news notifications, blah, blah blah."
6:44
By the time I get an Amber alert, I'm like, "Ugh.
6:49
Good luck, Amber. (audience laughs)
6:54
Enjoy the back of the blue Camry.
6:58
I got 18 notifications, I'm gonna go fight crime right now,
7:01
is that what's happening?
7:03
I gotta email my boss.
7:04
I'm not gonna fucking track down a Passat
7:06
on the freeway and ram it into the road.
7:09
I'm not a crime fighter, you just made my day worse.
7:12
I dunno what to do." (audience laughs)
