NEW YORK.
0:38
HERE I AM.
0:39
[LAUGHTER CONTINUES]
0:41
OH, MY GOD.
0:42
I ACTUALLY LIVE IN LOS ANGELES,
0:44
AND I TRAVEL AROUND A LOT.
0:46
IT SEEMS LIKE EVERY TIME I COME
0:49
BACK HOME, I NOTICE MORE AND
0:53
MORE WOMEN ARE GETTING FAKE
0:55
BOOBS.
0:57
MEANWHILE, I HAVEN'T EVEN GOTTEN
0:59
REAL ONES YET.
1:01
[LAUGHTER]
1:04
I MEAN, I HAVE BOOBS.
1:06
THEY'RE JUST CONCAVE.
1:10
[LAUGHTER]
1:14
SO MUCH SO THEY EVEN KIND OF
1:16
STICK OUT OF MY BACK A LITTLE
1:17
BIT.
1:18
[LAUGHTER CONTINUES]
1:20
THAT'S HOT.
1:22
[LAUGHTER]
1:25
I--
1:26
I'M ORIGINALLY FROM--
1:28
WAS BORN IN THE BIG APPLE.
1:32
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
1:40
NO WAY.
1:41
JACKSON, MISSISSIPPI.
1:42
[LAUGHTER]
1:44
GET OUTTA HERE.
1:46
IT'S VERY UNUSUAL.
1:47
[LAUGHTER CONTINUES]
1:49
YOU DON'T RUN INTO THAT MUCH.
1:50
YOU LAUGH, BUT IT'S VERY
1:52
UNUSUAL.
1:53
I--
1:54
MY WHOLE FAMILY'S STILL DOWN
1:55
THERE IN TEXAS, LOUISIANA,
1:56
MISSISSIPPI.
1:58
[SILENCE]
1:59
THANKS FOR YOUR SUPPORT.
2:00
[LAUGHTER]
2:02
I WAS DOWN THERE IN AUGUST
2:03
HANGING OUT WITH MY CRAZY
2:04
REDNECK AUNT SHEILA.
2:06
WE WERE SITTING ON HER BACK
2:08
PORCH, AND SHE PUT HER ARM
2:10
AROUND ME, AND SHE WAS LIKE--
2:11
"TIG, IT'S PRETTY OUTSIDE.
2:16
DON'T IT."
2:18
[LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE]
2:23
I WAS LIKE, "YEAH, SHEILA.
2:24
IT DOES."
2:26
[LAUGHTER]
2:28
'CAUSE IT DID.
2:29
[LAUGHTER]
2:31
IT REALLY, REALLY HAD.
2:32
[LAUGHTER CONTINUES]
2:35
I WENT ON A HARDCORE DRINKING
2:38
AND SMOKING BINGE.
2:41
AND IT LATEST RIGHT ABOUT NINE
2:43
MONTHS.
2:46
AND THEN, AS SOON AS I WAS
2:47
BORN...
2:48
[LAUGHTER]
2:50
IT WAS LIKE WHEW!
2:51
DO NOT GO IN THERE.
2:53
[LAUGHTER]
2:57
AFTER I MOVED OUT OF THE HOUSE
2:58
I USED TO COME HOME TO VISIT.
2:59
AND MY MOTHER AND I WOULD SIT UP
3:00
'TIL ALL HOURS OF THE NIGHT,
3:01
TALKING, AND SHE'D BE HAVING A
3:03
COCKTAIL, AND SHE'D SAY, "TIG,
3:05
TELL ME SOME MORE STORIES ABOUT
3:07
WHAT YOU WERE LIKE AS A CHILD."
3:09
[LAUGHTER]
3:12
I WAS LIKE, "ALRIGHT, ONE MORE.
3:14
I THINK IT'S SOMEONE'S BEDTIME."
3:17
[LAUGHTER]
3:18
THIS LAST TIME I WAS VISITING,
3:19
SHE WAS LIKE, "TIG, REMEMBER
3:22
WHEN YOU WERE A LITTLE BOY?"
3:24
[LAUGHTER]
3:26
I WAS LIKE, "VAGUELY."
3:30
"BUT KEEP GOING, YOU'VE PEAKED
3:31
MY INTEREST."
3:33
[LAUGHTER]
3:36
HERE'S SOMETHING KIND OF WEIRD.
3:37
I'VE BEEN BATTLING SIDS MY WHOLE
3:39
LIFE.
3:40
[LAUGHTER]
3:49
BUT I'VE BEEN ONE OF THE UNUSUAL
3:51
CASES.
3:54
MINE HASN'T BEEN SO SUDDEN.
3:57
IT'S STILL FRIGHTENING TO KNOW
3:59
I COULD GO AT ANY MOMENT.
4:00
[LAUGHTER]
4:04
I WAS ONE OF THOSE KIDS THAT
4:05
FINISHED SCHOOL EARLY,
4:06
BY DROPPING OUT.
4:08
[LAUGHTER]
4:10
THANK YOU.
4:12
[LAUGHTER]
4:14
AND WHEN I DID DROP OUT,
4:15
A TEACHER OF MINE, I REMEMBER
4:16
HER TELLING ME THAT A FRIEND
4:18
OF HERS DROPPED OUT AND ENDED UP
4:20
A STRIPPER ON DRUGS.
4:24
KIND OF INSINUATING THE SAME
4:25
THING WAS PROBABLY GONNA HAPPEN
4:27
TO ME.
4:28
ME.
4:31
[LAUGHTER]
4:34
I DON'T KNOW.
4:36
MY LACK OF INTEREST IN ALGEBRA
4:37
AND AMERICAN HISTORY HARDLY
4:39
MAKES ME WANT TO DANCE TOPLESS.
4:40
[LAUGHTER]
4:43
IN FACT, I'VE NEVER EVEN DANCED
4:45
WITH MY SHIRT ON.
4:47
JUST NOT MUCH OF A DANCER,
4:49
I GUESS.
4:50
[LAUGHTER CONTINUES]
4:52
I'D LIKE TO SEND A MESSAGE OUT
4:53
TO THE KIDS AT HOME, ACTUALLY,
4:55
IF I COULD.
4:57
AH...
4:58
STAY IN SCHOOL.
5:02
DO NOT DROP OUT.
5:04
'CAUSE IF YOU DO, THERE'S A
5:07
CHANCE YOU COULD END UP ON TV
5:10
WITH YOUR OWN COMEDY SPECIAL
5:11
MAKIN'--
5:14

5:18
♪ [MUSIC PLAYING]
5:25
♪ [MUSIC PLAYING]
5:30
Tig: YEAH.
5:32
[LAUGHTER]
5:34
I HAVE AN INDOOR CAT.
5:35
AND JUST WANTED YOU GUYS TO KNOW
5:37
THAT.
5:39
[LAUGHTER]
5:41
SHE'S NEVER BEEN OUTSIDE.
5:43
I DON'T EVEN THINK SHE KNOWS
5:45
THERE'S SUCH A THING AS THE
5:46
OUTDOORS.
5:49
I THINK SHE THINKS THAT WHEN
5:50
I LEAVE FOR THE DAY I'M JUST
5:52
STANDING ON THE OTHER SIDE OF
5:55
THE DOOR FOR 12 HOURS.
5:56
[LAUGHTER]
5:58
I JUST COME BACK INSIDE.
6:00
[LAUGHTER CONTINUES]
6:02
AND WHEN I DO COME BACK IN,
6:05
SHE'S ALWAYS STARTLED.
6:08
SHE DOES THAT SIDEWAYS CRABWALK
6:12
WITH HER HAIR STICKING UP.
6:14
I'M LIKE, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
6:17
I OWN YOU.
6:19
[LAUGHTER]
6:21
I BOUGHT YOU AT THE POUND FOR
6:22
$36, INCLUDING SHOTS.
6:26
I SAVED YOU FROM DEATH.
6:28
NOW, GO SIT DOWN AND RELAX.
6:30
[LAUGHTER]
6:33
I THINK SHE THINKS I'M JUST
6:34
LIKE A NEIGHBOR STORING [BLEEP]
6:36
AT HER PLACE.
6:37
[LAUGHTER]
6:42
COMING OVER UNANNOUNCED.
6:45
SO, IT'S JUST ME AND MY CAT
6:48
HANGING AROUND THE HOUSE.
6:50
WHEN I SAY HOUSE, I MEAN...
6:53
A ONE ROOM [BLEEP]HOLE THAT
6:55
I CAN HARDLY AFFORD.
6:56
[LAUGHTER]
6:59
BUT I DON'T HAVE A JOB.
7:01
I MEAN, I GUESS I DO.
7:03
IT'S KIND OF RIDICULOUS,
7:05
THOUGH, WHAT I DO.
7:08
I FEEL LIKE I JUST TELL JOKES
7:10
AND MONEY SHOWS UP.
7:11
[LAUGHTER]
7:14
BEFORE I CAME TO NEW YORK,
7:15
I CHECKED MY BALANCE, AND THE
7:16
AUTOMATED TELLER WAS LIKE,
7:18
"YOU HAVE SEVEN CENTS."
7:22
[LAUGHTER]
7:26
IT'S NICE.
7:28
IT'S THE FIRST TIME IN MY LIFE
7:29
I'VE HAD A DISPOSABLE INCOME.
7:31
[LAUGHTER]
7:34
AH.
7:36
IT'S WEIRD BEING A COMIC,
7:37
BECAUSE IT'S LIKE-- AT MOST,
7:39
I WORK AN HOUR A DAY, FIVE DAYS
7:40
A WEEK.
7:42
AND-- THERE'S-- 23 HOURS
7:45
TO KILL.
7:46
[LAUGHTER]
7:48
AND THEN THERE'S SOMETIMES WHERE
7:49
THERE'S WEEKS ON END WHERE
7:51
I DON'T WORK AT ALL.
7:52
SO, IF IT WASN'T FOR THE STREET
7:55
SWEEPING SIGNS, MY NEIGHBORHOOD,
7:58
I WOULD HAVE NO MOTIVATION
8:00
WHATSOEVER TO GET OUT OF BED.
8:02
[LAUGHTER]
8:05
BUT THERE I AM, EVERY TUESDAY,
8:06
AT SIX A.M...
8:08
[LAUGHTER]
8:11
PASSIVELY-AGGRESSIVELY FIGHTING
8:14
MY NEIGHBORS FOR THE SAME SPOT
8:15
THAT I KNOW I'LL NEVER GET.
8:19
I NEVER DO.
8:21
I ALWAYS END UP HAVING TO PARK
8:22
IN THE SAME PLACE, LIKE FIVE
8:24
BLOCKS AWAY.
8:26
NOW, I'M JUST THINKING ABOUT
8:27
MOVING DOWN THERE.
8:29
[LAUGHTER]
8:31
SEEMS TO MAKE THE MOST SENSE.
8:33
AND IF COMEDY DOESN'T WORK OUT,
8:35
WHAT AM I SAYING?
8:38
[LAUGHTER]
8:41
IF COMEDY DOESN'T WORK OUT,
8:43
I JUST WORKED A WEEK IN SOUTH
8:44
BEND INDIANA.
8:46
I THINK IT'S CLEAR THAT COMEDY
8:47
HAS WORKED OUT.
8:49
[LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE]
8:51
YEAH.
8:53
OH, YEAH.
8:56
IT'S VERY EXCITING.
8:58
NO, I'M TRYING TO COME UP WITH
9:00
A BACK-UP PLAN, BECAUSE I DON'T
9:01
KNOW, I JUST--
9:03
I'M COMING UP WITH ALL THESE
9:05
TV SHOW IDEAS.
9:06
I HAVE ONE THAT'S A REALITY
9:09
SHOW, YOU KNOW, WITH ALL THE
9:11
REALITY TV CRAZE, I FIGURED I'D
9:12
COME UP WITH ONE.
9:14
LET ME KNOW WHAT YOU THINK.
9:16
IT'S CALLED INCEST SURVIVOR:
9:18
APPALACHIA.
9:21
[LAUGHTER]
9:23
KEEP AN EYE OUT FOR IT.
9:25
I THINK IT'S GONNA BE VERY
9:26
POPULAR.
9:27
THAT'S REALITY TV.
9:29
AND THEN, IF THAT DOESN'T FLY,
9:31
I KNOW THE NETWORKS ARE VERY
9:32
EXCITED ABOUT INAPPROPRIATELY
9:34
TOUCHED BY AN ANGEL.
9:38
[LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE]
9:42
OH, I WAS AT A PARTY, AND THIS
9:43
GUY WAS HITTING ON ME.
9:45
BUT HE WAS HITTING ON ME WITH
9:47
THE MOST BORING QUESTIONS.
9:49
ONE OF THEM WAS-- IF YOU COULD
9:52
GO ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD,
9:54
WHERE WOULD YOU GO?
9:57
AND I WAS LIKE, "ANYWHERE?"
10:01
AND HE WAS LIKE, "ANYWHERE?"
10:04
I WAS LIKE--
10:07
"TO THE OTHER SIDE OF THE ROOM."
10:10
[LAUGHTER, CHEERS & APPLAUSE]
10:20
"NOW PLEASE, GET OUT OF THE WAY
10:21
OF A WOMAN AND HER DREAM."
10:22
[LAUGHTER]
10:28
I--
10:29
AT THAT SAME PARTY, I MET THIS
10:31
DOCTOR THAT WAS TELLING ME ABOUT
10:33
THAT WHOLE PHENOMENON OF PEOPLE
10:34
PUTTING THINGS IN PARTS OF THEIR
10:36
BODY FOR PLEASURE.
10:39
AND ENDING UP GETTING THEM
10:41
STUCK.
10:43
[LAUGHTER]
10:46
THINGS LIKE LIGHT BULBS.
10:49
[LAUGHTER CONTINUES]
10:52
AND I'VE HEARD ABOUT THIS.
10:55
BUT IT WASN'T UNTIL THIS
10:56
PARTICULAR CONVERSATION THAT IT
10:58
DAWNED ON ME.
11:01
HOW LONG YOU GOTTA BE TRYING
11:04
TO GET THAT OUT OF YOUR ASS
11:07
BEFORE YOU GO FOR HELP.
11:12
[LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE]
11:17
IT'S GOTTA BE HOURS...

11:42
MY ASS.

[LAUGHTER]
11:45
SHOOT.
11:48
MAYBE I'LL GIVE THE NEIGHBORS
11:50
A CALL, SEE IF THEY'LL SWING BY.
11:51
LIKE, I IMAGINE YOU WANT TO
11:54
INVOLVE AS FEW PEOPLE AS
11:56
POSSIBLE.
11:57
[LAUGHTER]
12:00
PROBABLY DON'T JUST PICK UP THE
12:01
PHONE REAL QUICK AND GO,
12:03
"CHRIS, MAN, IT'S JIM.
12:04
LISTEN...
12:06
[LAUGHTER]
12:08
I GOT A LIGHT BULB CRAMMED UP
12:10
MY ASS.
12:13
YES, AGAIN.
12:16

12:18
I WAS WONDERING IF YOU COULD
12:19
RUN ME BY THE ER.
12:21
YEAH, WHENEVER IS GOOD FOR YOU.
12:24
IN FACT, I'M GONNA GO OUTSIDE
12:24

12:49
THE TRUTH.
12:51
EVEN THOUGH THEY KNOW, THAT
12:53
YOU KNOW, THAT THEY KNOW,
12:55
EVERYBODY KNOWS WHAT'S GOING ON.
12:58
[LAUGHTER]
13:01
YOU CAN'T JUST TELL THE TRUTH.
13:02
PROBABLY LIKE, "OH, GOD.
13:05

BULB.
13:13
[LAUGHTER]

PUBLICATION.
18:20
THEY HAVE A LOT OF REALLY GREAT
18:22

18:24
EXPENSIVE.
