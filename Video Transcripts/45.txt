We gotta make a lot of changes in this country.
0:02
We really do, and I think one way this really starts,
0:05
especially make it better for women and young girls growing up,
0:08
we gotta get rid of the pink tax, okay? Or the tampon tax.
0:12
If you guys don't know what this is,
0:13
it is a luxury tax that women pay
0:16
on all of our tampons and pads.
0:18
'Cause if you guys didn't know this,
0:19
apparently my period is a luxurious experience.
0:24
( moans )
0:27
It's like a Sandals resort down there.
0:33
- And that's bullshit, right? - Woman: Whoo!
0:35
'Cause if-- thank you, right?
0:37
( cheers and applause )
0:39
- Right? Yeah. - Man: Yes.
0:44
All right, 'cause if a tampon is a BMW,
0:47
what's my Kia option?
0:51
It's just a bunch of Q-tips tied together?
1:01
Maybe it's like a day-old baguette from Whole Foods.
1:04
What am I using?
1:11
We're all friends here, right?
1:13
We're all buds.
1:15
So I'm gonna tell you guys what I use.
1:17
I use what's called a diva cup.
1:18
- Yeah. - ( cheering )
1:20
All right, a couple of you guys know.
1:22
Do you know what it is?
1:23
( laughing ) Oh, I can't wait!
1:28
( laughing ) All right.
1:30
Okay, buddy, buckle up. So...
1:34
what it is, all right,
1:36
is it is a silicone cup-- nay, a chalice...
1:44
that you put in there, okay?
1:46
And then when it's full, it's caught all the stuffs--
1:49
it's full, you just take it out,
1:52
and then you throw it on your enemies, so...
2:04
I'm a fat bitch, if you guys couldn't tell.
2:07
Let me hear it for all my plus-size bitches.
2:10
- ( cheering ) - Thank you.
2:13
If you didn't clap, fuck you, I hope you die.
2:18
I didn't see you clap.
2:27
I'm waiting for you to clap.
2:30
Are your hands broken? Thank you.
2:34
I am not having sex with him.
2:41
I'm comfortable with being a plus-sized lady.
2:44
I'm cool with it, but I live in L.A.
2:45
It sucks, right?
2:47
'Cause I know in L.A., I'm like a solid six,
2:49
maybe like a six and a half.
2:51
I go back home to Minnesota, I'm a nine.
2:53
Okay? Because I have a body that's useful.
2:56
I can haul wood with this body, okay?
2:59
If it gets too cold, I'll stand in the corner,
3:02
heat the whole house, all right?
3:03
That's the kind of body I have.
3:05
But living in L.A., I constantly have to prove to people
3:09
that I like myself, right?
3:11
No one believes you. So I did it, all right.
3:14
People are always like, "Prove it." I proved it.
3:15
I wore a crop top on TV, right?
3:18
( cheering )
3:24
People are like, "Oh, you're such an inspiration."
3:29
And I was like, "Why? It's on clearance. That's it.
3:32
That's the only reason I wore this thing."
3:33
And they were like, "Well, aren't you scared?
3:36
Aren't you scared of the trolls?"
3:39
And I was like, "The trolls? No, I'm not scared."
3:42
Last time I got trolled, the guy said this.
3:44
He goes, "Ugh, I can't imagine
3:47
trying to have sex with the folds of her fat."
3:49
And I'm like, "But you did, so I win!"
3:54
Okay?
3:56
I'm not scared.
3:59
But it is a double standard, I will give you that.
4:02
It's a double standard, okay?
4:03
'Cause I'm a goddamn hero. Right?
4:06
Skinny girls will take an Instagram picture,
4:08
maybe show a little boob, a little bit of butt.
4:10
People are like, "Oh, what a slut.
4:11
They're such a slut."
4:13
I do it, and they're like, "Oh!"
4:18
"You go, girl! How do you do it?
4:22
So confident in that disgusting body
4:25
you live in every single day?"
4:31
It's so ridiculous.
4:34
But I will be honest with you guys, all right?
4:37
I do love myself, and it took me a really long time to get here,
4:40
to like my body, and like who I am.
4:41
And I'm saying that all you guys here,
4:43
if you hate your body and hate the way you look for any reason,
4:46
you're stupid. You look great.
4:47
Give yourselves a round of applause
4:49
for being so beautiful, right?
4:51
( cheering )
4:56
And I actually-- I have an eating disorder.
4:59
I have a food addiction, okay?
5:00
And I know some of you here, especially the cunt that just laughed,
5:03
don't think it's a real thing, okay?
5:06
I see you.
5:08
It is a real thing 'cause I've done crazy things for food, okay?
5:13
I've sucked dick for food.
5:17
They thought it was a date, but I knew what I wanted.
5:26
I've eaten out of a trash can before.
5:29
Yeah, I'm not proud.
5:32
But I kind of am.
5:35
Kind of like when you fart so bad, you're just like,
5:37
"Oh, my God, that was horrible.
5:38
I made that."
