(audience cheers and applauds)
0:13
Thank you, guys.
0:15
Oh.
0:19
We did it, we're all here!
0:21
Oh. You're here.
0:23
You're here.
0:24
I didn't think you'd come, but there you are.
0:26
(audience laughs)
0:28
So, I-I made a recent realization in my life
0:31
that I'd like to share with you guys.
0:33
There is no way to pick up pills
0:38
that you've spilled on the ground
0:41
without looking like a total human red flag.
0:47
You know? There's just no way to be like,
0:48
"Oh!" (laughs)
0:51
(singsongy): "This is what I meant to do.
0:55
And everything is going great!"
0:59
Like, as soon as it happens, you're always like,
1:02
(sharp exhale)
1:04
"I'm so sorry.
1:07
I need these!"
1:12
"Mama's medicine, you know?"
1:15
(chuckles)
1:17
Like, it immediately turns into a sad one-woman show
1:20
that nobody agreed to attend.
1:24
No, I-I do take a healthy diet of pills,
1:26
but they are prescribed, uh...
1:28
Though, though I would say,
1:30
you know, pills, they're a great anytime snack.
1:32
They, um, they come through in that way.
1:35
But, no, I suffer from depression, uh...
1:38
It's a great way to start off a set, you know?
1:40
Uh, sorry to go blue right away, but it's true.
1:43
I...
1:44
No, I-I, I've had it my whole life and,
1:48
you know, it's like a lot times, I'll feel sad for no reason.
1:52
But then I'll remember some of the reasons.
1:56
You know?
2:01
Like, "This actually makes a lot of sense.
2:04
This adds up."
2:08
There are, uh, certain types of weather
2:10
that are better for depressives.
2:11
Like, I love it when it rains.
2:13
Reminds me of why I got in the whole sad game, you know?
2:16
Keeps me grounded.
2:19
Whenever it's, like, pouring outside, as a, as a sad person,
2:22
you can turn to any random optimist on the street
2:24
and just be like, "Hey.
2:25
"You're in my world now.
2:28
What?"
2:30
(chuckles)
2:32
Yeah, I, I relate to people who have self-doubt.
2:35
I, I have a lot of anxiety, um...
2:36
Don't be mistaken by the sassy drag queen stage persona.
2:40
It's, uh...
2:41
I know, it's confusing.
2:43
But, yeah, I have a lot of anxiety.
2:45
I don't know, I feel like i-it's weirder to not have anxiety
2:48
than to have it, 'cause I feel like, if you're not scared,
2:50
you're not paying attention, you know?
2:53
Like, I feel like
2:54
if you opened a newspaper today,
2:55
skimmed maybe three headlines, you're just like,
2:58
"Seems cool."
2:59
It's like, what? Everything's on fire.
3:02
Even the newspaper is on fire.
3:04
Like, what are you so chill about?
3:05
And, you know,
3:07
sometimes when you tell people you have anxiety,
3:09
they're always like, "Well, you know,
3:11
there's nothing to fear but fear itself."
3:14
It's like, okay.
3:16
Have you checked out some of fear's work?
3:21
It's, like, pretty much churning out solid gold hits.
3:25
Making some great points, rarely misfires.
3:28
And, like, if you don't have anxiety,
3:31
the way I would describe it, is like
3:33
there's an edgy improv group in your brain,
3:38
and it just needs,
3:39
like, a one-word suggestion...
3:45
...to spin, like, countless scenarios
3:47
that no one's comfortable with.
3:50
Like, the whole time, you're just like,
3:53
"When will this show be over?
3:55
I just came to be supportive."
3:59
"None of these thoughts have a future."
4:03
And, you know,
4:05
I have all kinds of anxiety.
4:06
I have, uh, social anxiety,
4:08
which is ironically one of the most relatable kinds.
4:11
Um, it's a little weird.
4:15
Sometimes mine will get so bad,
4:18
I can't even talk to babies without getting self-conscious.
4:22
Yeah, like, the whole time I'm just like,
4:23
"Oh, what if I'm not an interesting shape or color?"
4:27
You know?
4:30
It's like, make a fist, try to relate.
4:32
Take out your keys.
4:34
Meet them on their level.
4:37
Yeah, social interaction is terrifying.
4:39
I also hate this one, I hate when, um,
4:42
you're going in for the handshake,
4:44
but the other person
4:45
is going in for the fist bump.
4:47
And then you realize you're in front of a mirror
4:50
and you don't know who you are anymore.
4:54
Last summer, I got cat-called.
4:56
Uh, which is not, you know, a cause for celebration.
4:59
But I'm just not someone who gets cat-called a lot.
5:02
I'm not sad about it, but I was thinking
5:04
why that might be the case.
5:06
I think, uh, some of it might be that a lot of times,
5:09
I'll wear an astronaut helmet around the city.
5:12
(laughter)
5:13
That definitely hurts my numbers.
5:16
I also think it's, like, my general energy
5:18
when I walk around, like, my vibe is a little bit like,
5:21
"Are you my mother?"
5:23
Like, that is...
5:25
that is the message I'm putting out into the universe.
5:29
You know, it's, like, a hint of orphan.
5:31
So, cat-callers are usually like,
5:34
"Eh, she's already scared, we'll get the next one."
5:38
(chuckling): Whatever their inner monologue is.
5:40
I'm sure it's darker than that.
5:43
(chuckles)
5:45
But, yeah, I got cat-called last summer and i-it was weird
5:47
just 'cause of how elaborate it was.
5:49
Like, there was a guy sitting
5:50
a couple stoops down from the building I live in,
5:53
and we don't normally have cat-callers on my block,
5:56
so it was, like, already a special day.
5:59
And then, I realized later he didn't even live on my block,
6:03
which made me think, like,
6:04
is cat-calling like jury duty?
6:07
Where you just get an address in the mail
6:09
and that's your assignment?
6:10
Or instead he's like,
6:12
"We just got to make sure women feel objectified
6:14
"fairly over all the,
6:15
you know, different neighborhoods."
6:17
So, every four years you're like,
6:19
"Okay, civic duty fulfilled."
6:21
So, anyway, he was sitting there.
6:22
I wasn't expecting anything,
6:24
I walk by him, and then he just goes,
6:27
"Hey, sweetie, look at you, looking all beautiful and shit."
6:31
Yeah.
6:33
You know, it's like, classic line, you can't argue with it.
6:37
Um, hitting all the bases.
6:40
It's, like, time-tested, mother-not-approved.
6:44
I didn't say anything, like, I didn't know how to react.
6:46
Like, I have barely developed a script
6:48
for when people I know are like, "Hey, Aparna, how's it going?"
6:53
So, it's like, anything outside of that...
6:55
it's like, I can't, I'm not ready.
6:57
I'll never be ready.
6:58
So, I walked by him, and then he keeps talking to me.
7:01
He's just like, "Oh, I see you."
7:04
I was like, "Okay, great, um...
7:07
"I think that's the baseline of what we've established here--
7:10
"we both see each other,
7:11
thank you for naming it."
7:13
And I keep walking, and he's just like, "There you go."
7:18
I was like "Is he just gonna keep narrating my day?
7:22
Very unimaginatively?"
7:24
And then I walked another block, he was still yelling at me,
7:27
I couldn't even hear him at this point,
7:29
and I turn around and he's kind of waving his arms.
7:31
I was like, "You know what?
7:33
Maybe he's just workshopping today."
7:36
You know? (chuckles)
7:37
It's not even what he's saying,
7:39
it's just, he's trying to run some new angles,
7:41
keeping his game sharp.
7:43
And then I had coffee with a friend.
7:44
I was gone maybe an hour,
7:46
I turned around, came back,
7:48
he was sitting in the exact same place.
7:50
I was like, "Great, this is my nightmare.
7:52
Uh, maybe he won't say anything."
7:54
I walk by him again, and he just goes,
7:57
"Skinnybones, is that you?"
8:05
Which, you know,
8:06
was such a departure from his previous work.
8:10
It was like a total genre shift.
8:14
It was, like, while I was gone,
8:15
he had moved into a new period as an artist.
8:20
That totally caught me off-guard,
8:22
and my first impulse was to laugh,
8:23
but I was like, "No, you can't give him anything."
8:26
Even though, I will be honest,
8:27
he did make my college eating disorder blush.
8:30
You know, I was like, "Thank you.
8:31
It's too much, please. No."
8:33
Uh...
8:34
And I was like, "Nope."
8:35
And I sort of scurried by him.
8:37
And then he was just like, "Skinnybones..."
8:42
Like we had this shared history
8:43
that I wasn't acknowledging.
8:46
He was like, "You remember me,
8:47
"we go back at least 45 minutes.
8:49
Don't deny your roots."
8:52
And then I was just like, "Nope, nope, nope."
8:54
And I sort of, like, rain-walked up the steps to my apartment.
8:56
As I went in the door, I just heard one last sad, resigned,
9:00
"Skinnybones."
9:03
It was like a full arc, you know?
9:05
As a character,
9:07
it was like, we all went on a journey down that block.
9:09
Emotionally.
9:12
I've also, um, I've also been getting into the Internet.
9:15
I don't know if you guys have been, it's pretty fun.
9:19
Uh, yeah, I got my AOL CD-- I'm finally on there, but...
9:25
The Internet is tricky-- I feel like you click on a link
9:27
and then you wake up five years later with a beard
9:30
and you're like, "What happened?"
9:32
My latest Achilles' heel on the Internet is list articles.
9:37
Uh, "listicles," I believe, is the time-saving term.
9:41
I don't know if you guys are familiar with them,
9:43
but it-- the whole point-- they're known as clickbait--
9:46
like, the whole point is just to get you to click on the link.
9:48
They just want those hits.
9:50
And there's a lot of sites that specialize in them.
9:52
There's, like, Buzzfeed, HuffPo, third site is doing great work.
9:57
Uh...
10:00
But, you know, at-at first, they started out normal
10:02
in terms of being enticing.
10:03
Like a typical one m-might be something like,
10:06
"12 Actresses Before They Were Famous."
10:10
You'd be like, "Oh.
10:12
Well, I'm not famous, let's relate."
10:16
Or it'd be like,
10:17
"37 Puppies So Cute, You'll Be Mad!"
10:20
And you're like, "I'm already mad, bring it on!"
10:25
(chuckles)
10:26
And then I feel like they ran out of all the normal ones
10:29
and they slowly started getting weirder,
10:31
'cause they have to put up, like, 70,000 a day--
10:33
it's a valuable job.
10:35
So y-you would start getting ones that were a little odd.
10:37
Like, "51 Burritos Without Makeup."
10:46
Guess there has to be some airbrushing involved.
10:50
Or it'd be like,
10:51
"300 Ways to Prove You're Real."
10:55
(muttering)
10:57
Am I real?
10:58
Huh.
10:59
Better check a hundred of those.
11:02
I can't wait till they run out of all the weird ones
11:05
and it just comes back full circle to mundane again.
11:09
And it's just like,
11:10
"The Ten Commandments!"
11:14
(giggles softly)
11:16
Guess I...
11:17
Hmm.
11:19
Guess I need a refresher.
11:23
Or just like, "Two Birds."
11:26
(muttering)
11:28
Is that even a list?
11:29
(grunts) Mad again!
11:31
Still have to look.
11:34
My problem with dating is, like,
11:36
you have to show up and be fun?
11:39
It's like, what are you, a king?
11:41
(laughter)
11:43
Like, you should just be glad that I'm real.
11:45
It's just a lot to ask.
11:47
And, you know, I've tried, uh, I've tried Internet dating,
11:50
that's big now.
11:51
Uh, I've tried a couple sites,
11:53
I've tried, um, Match, I've tried "OkCup-id," uh...
11:57
I-I, I spent a good month on Yelp.
12:01
You know, like, I feel like I've...
12:02
gone the distance.
12:04
But, I, I even had to think outside the box this past year.
12:08
Like, I, I got asked out over Facebook.
12:10
Uh, which, in and of itself, isn't that interesting,
12:13
but the thing is, it was someone I didn't know.
12:16
And they sent me a message.
12:18
They were just like, "Oh, I saw you do stand-up at a show.
12:21
Uh, I thought you were really funny, let's go out."
12:23
And, normally, I would be like, "No."
12:26
But I was at a vulnerable point in my life, and I was also like,
12:28
"You know what? He didn't even ask, he just decided.
12:30
"Like, I respect
12:32
that decisiveness in a man."
12:34
And it's also like, what is that expression?
12:36
YODO, you know, "you only date occasionally," so...
12:41
you have to take the opportunities
12:43
when they present themselves.
12:44
Uh, the one thing that was weird about him right off the bat,
12:49
was that his profile picture was just a Santa emoji.
12:54
(audience chuckles)
12:55
I know, it's a right reaction, it's, like, right away,
12:57
there's a slight chance he doesn't have a face.
13:01
Uh, or that his face is, in fact, a Santa emoji,
13:05
and it's like, you know, I'm open-minded,
13:06
but it's gonna be a discussion eventually.
13:09
Uh... so I had my friend Google him,
13:11
and she was like, "No, he checks out.
13:13
He has a face, you're good to go."
13:15
Yeah, I don't like to Google people before the first date,
13:18
I'm kind of old-fashioned.
13:19
I feel like some things you should save for marriage.
13:21
Uh... but she was like, "No, he checks out, go on the date."
13:25
So, we made plans, I believe I picked the place.
13:28
Like, I tried to pick a bar where it was, like,
13:30
if I go missing, people'll be like,
13:32
"At least she had a good time before she left."
13:34
Yeah, at least four stars.
13:36
So, we met up,
13:38
and first impressions, I have to say, were great.
13:41
He was tall, he smelled good, he had a face-- triple-threat.
13:47
Everything matched up.
13:49
And then we sat down, he bought us drinks, we started talking,
13:52
And then one of the first things he said,
13:54
where it was just like,
13:55
"Red flag meter alerted!"
13:58
One of the first things out of his mouth, he was just like,
14:00
"Uh, something you should know about me,
14:03
"I'm really big on honesty.
14:05
I just like telling it how it is."
14:07
It's like, okay, who opens with that as a human?
14:12
Who, like, right out of the gate is just like,
14:14
"Listen, you're gonna hear some stuff."
14:16
Uh...
14:18
And it's also, like, honesty on a first date?
14:22
No, thanks.
14:26
Like, call me old-fashioned,
14:27
but I feel like dating is like health insurance.
14:30
Like, you wait until you're accepted in as a member...
14:33
before you start revealing all your preexisting conditions.
14:39
(applause)
14:41
Yes, feel free.
14:44
(chuckles)
14:47
Like, it feels like, uh,
14:48
you know, you wait until year five
14:49
before you're like, "Oh, by the way,
14:51
"I have diabetes and another family.
14:53
Happy anniversary!"
14:59
But it was like, "Night is young,
15:00
let's just see where it goes." Um, we started talking.
15:02
We didn't have a lot in common.
15:03
He was like, "I work in finance."
15:05
I was like, "I have no money."
15:06
Uh, we were hitting a few walls.
15:09
And then, maybe halfway through the night,
15:12
there was a lull in the conversation,
15:13
and then he was just like,
15:15
"You know, I'm actually pretty funny.
15:16
I could be a comedian if I wanted."
15:19
Oh, oh, wow.
15:21
You guys reacted with the perfect combination of, uh,
15:25
quiet horror and disgust.
15:28
And you were not prepped.
15:30
Uh, first of all,
15:32
that's not how being funny works.
15:34
You don't have to give someone a heads-up that you're funny.
15:39
You don't have to be like, "Oh, I forgot to tell you,
15:41
"I'm funny.
15:44
So you've been missing a lot of cues on your end."
15:49
"Some of your facial expressions aren't reading."
15:53
But, yeah, and it's also so condescending to be like,
15:56
"Oh, you know that thing you do, that you work pretty hard at
15:59
"and made a lot of sacrifices for?
16:01
"I've thought about doing it, but, uh, I'm too good.
16:06
I'm too good!"
16:09
It's so condescending-- you wouldn't do that
16:11
for any other career. You wouldn't be like,
16:13
"Oh, check this out:
16:14
"I've seen the moon a couple times.
16:17
I'm pretty sure I'm space material."
16:20
Like, it is as ridiculous as saying that.
16:23
But, at that point, if I remember correctly,
16:25
a cockroach ran across our table.
16:28
Yes, I know, so it was a very nice act break,
16:31
uh...
16:33
It should have been foreshadowing,
16:34
I just didn't pick up on it at that point.
16:36
'Cause after that, the date completely derailed,
16:39
and he-- he just turned into an Amazon algorithm
16:43
where he was just like,
16:44
"You might also not like the next thing I'm gonna say."
16:51
(chuckles)
16:53
(laughing): Because...
16:54
then we really ran out of everything to talk about.
16:57
Like, I feel like the date itself
16:58
stood up and left the room
16:59
and we were still sitting there for some reason.
17:01
It was like a fund-raiser at that point.
17:03
(chuckles)
17:05
Like, I feel like we discussed the levels of our waters.
17:07
You're like, "Oh, you drink more, that's great for you.
17:09
It shows in your skin."
17:11
Like, it was really bottom of the barrel.
17:12
And then, circling back to his original statement,
17:15
he was just like, "You know, I should tell you this.
17:18
"I actually only friended you on Facebook
17:20
'cause you're an Indian comedian."
17:22
He was Indian as well.
17:23
And I was like, "Okay."
17:25
And he was like, "Yeah, I just wanted to support
17:27
"an Indian artist; I didn't actually think
17:29
you were that funny."
17:30
(audience gasps)
17:31
I was just like, "Wha-- why...
17:35
"why are you...
17:39
"Why are you?
17:42
"Why are you saying this out loud...
17:46
"to me?
17:48
"I feel like there are so many other people
17:49
"you could say this to.
17:50
"There is an Internet specifically
17:51
for these types of grievances, you know?"
17:55
And I feel like I-I just started to make the face
17:58
of someone who's, like, eyes are bleeding,
18:00
but there's no blood.
18:01
I was just like, "Why?
18:03
Why do you bring this plague on my people?"
18:06
And then he waited a second,
18:08
and then he was just like,
18:10
"That was a joke."
18:11
And I was like, "What?"
18:16
Like, I immediately reached the level of outrage
18:18
of someone ripping off two monocles at the same time.
18:21
Like, I was so mad.
18:23
(laughing): Just, like,
18:25
taking off wigs I wasn't wearing just like,
18:27
"Sir, how dare you
18:29
insult me with my craft in front of my children?"
18:32
I was like, pointing at my coat,
18:33
like, it didn't make sense anymore.
18:36
And then he was just like, "That was a joke.
18:37
Do something, react!"
18:39
And I didn't, I just sat there,
18:40
like, physically left my body.
18:43
And then he reached across the table
18:47
and he forced my mouth into a smile.
18:49
(audience groans)
18:50
(Aparna groans)
18:53
He smile-violated me.
18:57
He "smiolated" me.
19:01
Like, my brain ran out of reactions in that moment.
19:03
It was just like, "Error, error.
19:04
"Situation does not compute.
19:06
Patriarchy overload!"
19:10
(chuckles)
19:14
It's like, women get mad
19:16
when they're told to smile on the street.
19:18
But to forcibly be smiled?
19:22
Like, I was mad at myself in that moment
19:24
for when he, like, touched my face,
19:25
not having it just melt off and be like,
19:28
"Now you're cursed.
19:30
"You failed the test.
19:32
There never was a date."
19:34
(chuckles)
19:37
But anyway, uh, the rest of the evening
19:39
can best be summed up from a quote from the movie Titanic,
19:43
which I had to copy down.
19:44
Uh, but you guys will see why it fits.
19:47
Okay, here it is.
19:48
"Afterward, the 700 people in the boats..."
19:52
That's me.
19:55
"...had nothing to do but wait."
19:59
"Wait to die.
20:03
"Wait to live.
20:05
Wait for an absolution that would never come."
20:10
Uh, so we are engaged.
20:11
I just thought it was so cute how we met.
20:16
Uh, guys, that's gonna be it for me, thank you so much.
20:18
Thank you, you've been really great.
20:20
Thank you. Thank you.
