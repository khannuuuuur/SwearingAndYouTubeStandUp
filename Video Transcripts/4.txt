- You know, we all get stuck on our smart devices
0:02
a little too much of the time
0:04
and this guy is no different.
0:05
His name is Earl, but you spell it U-R-L.
0:08
Please help me welcome the new guy, Url.

Hi, Url.
0:56
Hey, dude.
0:59
What are you doing?
1:00
I'm texting.
1:01
I know, but why now?
1:04
Url?
1:05
I'm texting.
1:07
Okay, but you know we have an audience.
1:09
Yeah, a lot of them are texting too.
1:11
(audience laughing)
1:14
Who are you texting?
1:15
I just texted you, "Hi, Jeff."
1:21
It says, "Hi, jerk."
1:23
(audience laughing)
1:24
Oh, damn you, autocorrect.
1:27
(audience laughing)
1:28
Why are you texting when we could be talking?
1:30
Where are you talking when we could be texting?
1:34
You know, Url, speaking in person is a better form
1:36
of communication.
1:37
Says you, boomer.
1:44
Okay, how about this?
1:45
Did you know that when I was your age, water was free?
1:48
Seriously?
1:50
I guess next you're gonna tell me you paid for porn.
2:00
Actually we did, yeah.
2:02
But today we pay for water and porn is free.
2:06
(audience laughing)
2:07
That's right.
2:08
I think we can agree on one thing.
2:09
Good trade off.
2:10
Yep. Cool.
2:11
All right.
2:13
(audience laughing)
2:16
How about this?
2:17
You know my generation invented the internet
2:18
and the personal computer.
2:20
Oh, so without you guys, I wouldn't have my phone.
2:23
Probably not.
2:26
What are you doing?
2:27
I just gave through the highest compliment
2:29
someone my age can.
2:30
What's that?
2:31
I just followed you on TikTok.
2:34
Okay but right now we're doing a live show
2:37
for a live audience.
2:38
Why?
2:39
They could just stay home and watch it on YouTube.
2:42
It's not gonna be on YouTube.
2:44
Yes it is.
2:46
(audience laughing)
2:49
No one here is recording it.
2:51
Dude, you are dumber than you look.
2:54
(audience laughing)
2:57
Things are not as good when you just see it on a screen.
3:00
Yeah, like what?
3:01
Like what a concert, sports.
3:03
Sex.
3:05
I would think it's not as good watching on a screen.
3:07
Yeah, you're watching the wrong sh (beep).
3:10
(audience laughing)
3:16
This is a live comedy show.
3:18
I'd rather watch it on TV.
3:20
Why?
3:21
I could fast forward through the lame stuff.
3:24
Have you seen any lame stuff so far tonight?
3:27
No.
3:28
Thank you.
3:28
Because I've been on my phone.
3:31
(audience laughing)
3:32
So you're addicted to your phone?
3:34
Yeah and?
3:35
Many of us are but you don't think
3:36
too much phone time is a bad thing?
3:38
Just make sure the camera doesn't come on
3:40
when you're toilet texting.
3:43
Well, I don't think that's ever happened to me.
3:47
