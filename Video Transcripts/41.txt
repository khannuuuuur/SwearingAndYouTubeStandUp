is when you pick your cat up, they get a kitty report card.
0:08
Which makes a lot of sense, you know?
0:10
Because cats have so many measurable skills.
0:13
[laughter]
0:15
And this is what Kevin's last report card said.
0:19
It said "Kevin enjoys playing with string.
0:27
"Maybe on his next visit,
0:29
he would enjoy playing with the laser light pointer."
0:35
And I saw that, and I called them up,
0:38
and I was, like, hey, man.
0:39
Why didn't you bring out
0:40
the laser light pointer on this trip?
0:43
He was there for a week. Bust it out.
0:46
Especially if you feel like he has an aptitude for it.
0:53
And they went "oh, Mr. Wengert, you don't understand.
0:57
Laser light pointer is one of our luxury activities."
1:01
I would need to spend another nine dollars
1:05
so that one of the employees
1:06
of the Best Little Cat House in Pasadena
1:09
shine a laser light pointer on the wall.
1:12
I'm not there yet.
1:13
[laughter]
1:16
I realize that not everyone has a cat,
1:19
so here's a universally relatable topic.
1:24
Have you ever gotten a song stuck in your head before?
1:27
Sure, Joe, we've all been there.
1:30
Those are called earworms when that happens.
1:34
And there's a remedy for earworms.
1:36
It sounds a little counter-intuitive,
1:39
but what you're supposed to do is
1:41
you're supposed to listen to that song
1:44
that you got stuck in your head
1:45
a bunch of times in a row on purpose,
1:48
and that'll kick the song out of your head.
1:50
And that works.
1:52
Unless the song that you have stuck in your head
1:57
is a song that you made up...
2:01
[laughter]
2:05
While you were doing laundry.
2:09
And now, welcome to my world.
2:12
This is where I've been living
2:14
for the past five or six months now.
2:17
Every private moment of my life,
2:21
especially at nighttime, when I lay me down to sleep,
2:27
I hear myself sing the following song.
2:34
♪ Some people like to see me do my thing ♪
2:38
♪ Some people like to see me move around ♪
2:42
Every night!
2:46
Every night.
2:48
And that's just how my life is going to go from here on out.
2:53
Unless if I can get the money together
2:55
to go into a recording studio to record myself going
3:01
♪ Some people like to see me do my thing ♪
3:03
♪ Some people like to see me move around ♪
3:06
Not true! It's also not true.
3:14
And I'm too old for that type of nonsense
3:17
at this point now.
3:20
I'm starting to go through a phase of my life
3:23
that I like to call old man puberty.
3:29
Because I'm getting more unnecessary hair
3:33
in more unexpected places.
3:38
Just like, zones of my body where I don't need any hair.
3:42
Like, I'm starting to get shoulder hair.
3:46
No one had prepared me for shoulder hair.
3:52
So when I get a shoulder hair, I just yank it out.
3:57
I just pull it out.
3:59
But if I don't get a good grip on it,
4:02
it'll slide between my fingernails.
4:05
And have you ever done that trick
4:07
when you're wrapping a birthday present,
4:10
and you pull the ribbon alongside a pair of scissors
4:15
for the curly-Q effect?
4:19
That's what happens to my shoulder hair.
4:22
So then, I have, like, fancy festive shoulder hair.
4:29
I live alone with a cat.
