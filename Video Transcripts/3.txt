So, tonight I wanna start off talking about something
0:40
a little important, right?
0:41
Uh, something I think applies to a lot of us.
0:44
It's a...popular topic today: Feminism. [chuckles]
0:48
- AUDIENCE: [laughing]
0:49
- But with a little bit of a twist tonight. Feminism...
0:54
- AUDIENCE: [laughing]
0:56
- For men! Yeah, sorry, ladies! You know?
1:00
[chuckles]
1:03
But like, for real, sorry.
1:05
- AUDIENCE: [laughing]
1:08
- Okay, so like, yes, you know, like...
1:11
men can be feminists, right?
1:13
My brother's always like, "Chad, how can you be a feminist
1:15
if you're always trying to get girls?"
1:17
And I'm like, "Boy, don't mansplain me."
1:19
- AUDIENCE: [laughs] - Chill.
1:21
If you don't mind, I'd love to share a really quick
1:23
anecdo' if that's cool with you.
1:26
So I was pledging at ASU-- Go, Devils! And...
1:29
- AUDIENCE: [laughing]
1:31
- ...I noticed, like, when I was sitting down--
1:33
--I was getting drunk and I was sitting down to pee
1:35
and noticed, like...
1:37
- AUDIENCE: [laughing]
1:42
- ...something, like, wrong, you know?
1:45
But no, it turns out that's just the beginning stages
1:47
of male feminism, everybody!
1:50
Happens to everybody, okay, so, what is feminism? Right?
1:55
That's a question that's on everybody's mind
1:56
and only Lena Dunham really seems to know the answer, so...
1:59
- AUDIENCE: [laughing] [applause]
2:04
- I'd love to like, just--
2:05
also, before I start this part of the show,
2:07
fam--which is my favorite gender-neutral way
2:08
to address a crowd--
2:09
- AUDIENCE: [laughing]
2:11
- --If I ask a question, feel free
2:13
to answer from your heart, not necessarily your mind.
2:15
- AUDIENCE: [laughing] - So, if you were going to say,
2:18
like, what is feminism, what would you say?
2:21
- Equality between the sexes.
2:22
- Okay, equality between the sexes, give it up, yeah!
2:26
- [cheering and applause] - Alright, alright.
2:28
And if you were gonna just like, spitball a year,
2:31
spitball a year that feminism started, what would you say?
2:34
- Ooh, 1970? - 1970s, okay, give it up.
2:39
Close, it was actually, uh...
2:42
- AUDIENCE: [laughing] [cheering and applause]
2:49
- It was actually 2013. [chuckles]
2:51
It was started by the musical recording artist Beyoncé, uh...
2:55
She has this album that, like, really breaks everything down,
2:57
I couldn't get the rights to play it,
2:59
even though my dad is a [bleep] lawyer, so...
3:02
I just got this quote that sort of, like,
3:04
breaks everything down...
3:13
Who do you think said that? - WOMEN: Beyoncé.
3:16
- Okay, close, it was actually...
3:19
- [cheering and applause] - Solange.
3:22
- [cheering continues]
3:25
- The creator of black feminism.
3:27
- AUDIENCE: [laughing]
3:31
- That's just a feminist enjoying nature.
3:33
- AUDIENCE: [laughing]
3:36
- Alright, you guys are probably like,
3:37
"Okay, Chad, like, how can you just
3:39
drag us like this and not give us anything to do?"
3:41
And like, whoa, I'll give you guys something
3:43
very actionable that we can all start doing right now,
3:45
we gotta stop cat-calling, you guys.
3:48
We gotta stop it.
3:49
I personally--I never really like, cat-called in real life,
3:52
I was more like a digital cat-caller, I just, like,
3:55
open Tinder messages and be like,
3:56
"What's up, queen? My face is a throne," you know?
3:58
Like...just sort of...
4:01
- AUDIENCE: [laughing]
4:04
- Stuff like that, but I don't do that anymore,
4:06
'cause I'm wiser.
4:07
Now I just drop facts about female scientists.
4:10
- AUDIENCE: [laughing, cheering]
4:11
- "Rosalind Franklin is remembered
4:13
"for her breakthrough discoveries in structured DNA
4:15
"that she never celebrated
4:16
due to an untimely death, baby girl."
4:18
- AUDIENCE: [laughing] - Works every time.
4:23
Put your own spin on it, you know?
4:25
- AUDIENCE: [laughing]
4:26
- Follow me on Twitter @wokeboy94, everybody!
4:29
- [cheering and applause]
4:31
- Okay, what's up, you guys?! What's up, New Orleans?!
4:35
- [cheering and applause]
4:37
- Yeah! Oh, my God.
4:39
- [cheering and applause]
4:41
- What's up?
4:42
- [cheering and applause]
4:48
- I am...I'm so happy to be in New Orleans,
4:50
it's way colder than I was expecting it to be here.
4:53
It's like a dangerous level of cold outside right now,
4:56
where a cold wind blows, you just, like,
4:57
wake up in an IKEA, like, three years deep
4:59
into a monogamous relationship, you know?
5:01
- AUDIENCE: [laughing] - [laughs]
5:05
You drink a latte too fast, you're just, like,
5:07
at your own flash mob proposal, just like...
5:09
- AUDIENCE: [laughing] - What happened? [chuckles]
5:12
I was living in LA for a year,
5:14
um, that shit was wack, honestly.
5:16
- AUDIENCE: [laughing] - It was wack.
5:18
I, like, tried doing all the California stuff, too,
5:20
like, when I was out there I tried going vegan
5:22
for a while, um, very up and down process,
5:25
mostly just 'cause whenever I would stand up,
5:26
I would just, like... [coughs] - AUDIENCE: [laughing]
5:30
- ...pass out. [laughs]
5:32
Wake up to someone doing my birth chart for me.
5:35
- AUDIENCE: [laughing]
5:38
- I also--I also tried yoga while I was in LA,
5:41
'cause I was like, "Yoga's easy, right? That's just, like,
5:43
laying on the ground for 45 minutes, I could do that,"
5:46
and then halfway through the first class
5:48
I was just like... [shudders] Shaking.
5:51
The instructor came to me,
5:52
"You can give up or you can try!"
5:54
- AUDIENCE: [laughing]
5:55
- I was like, "Oh, my God.
5:57
"I feel so attacked
5:58
by this dude in a Spiritual Gangster crop top."
6:01
- AUDIENCE: [laughing]
6:02
- Trying to gentrify my muscles right now.
6:05
- AUDIENCE: [laughing]
6:06
- I also love how yoga has basically just become, like,
6:09
a slow electric slide for white people at this point?
6:11
- AUDIENCE: [laughing]
6:13
- Like, "To the left..." - AUDIENCE: [laughing]
6:15
- "Take it back now, yeah." - AUDIENCE: [laughing]
6:18
- "Now, maintaining that breath, one-hop this side..."
6:21
- AUDIENCE: [laughing]
6:26
- Also, white people, y'all went the [bleep] off
6:28
when you made buffalo cauliflower, like, oh, mwah!
6:33
It's so good! Keep that energy up!
6:36
You know, like, stop calling the cops,
6:38
get in the kitchen, like... honestly.
6:41
- AUDIENCE: [cheering and applause]
6:52
- But I was like, "You know,
6:53
"any exercise I do is gonna be difficult,
6:55
"that's kinda the point of exercise.
6:57
"I might as well go all the way,
6:58
"I'm gonna take an MMA class, I'm gonna learn how to fight."
7:02
- AUDIENCE: [laughing]
7:03
- I learned one cool thing from this class,
7:05
I learned that if someone is attacking you
7:06
and standing up like this, right?
7:08
What you gotta do is take your arm up, twist your body,
7:11
drop your elbow, you can get out of the hold safe, right?
7:14
But the instructor prefaced, saying like,
7:16
"Sometimes you're in the middle of a fight, you don't have time
7:19
to do all that choreo or whatever,
7:22
you gotta do whatever it takes to get out of that hold,"
7:24
and I was like, "Okay, got you."
7:26
My sparring partner put his hand around my throat and I went,
7:28
"Ugh, Daddy."
7:30
- AUDIENCE: [laughing]
7:33
- And he let go, you know?!
7:36
Sometimes love wins! That's all it takes.
7:39
- AUDIENCE: [cheering and applause]
7:44
- I was taking a lot of rideshares when I was in LA,
7:47
because I can't drive because I'm gay, and I...
7:50
- AUDIENCE: [laughing]
7:54
- I had this driver this one time,
7:56
he had a 3.8 rating, like, are you murdering people?
8:01
- AUDIENCE: [laughing]
8:03
- I got out the car and like, zig-zagged to my apartment.
8:05
Just in case the guy turned around and just... [spits]
8:07
- AUDIENCE: [laughing]
8:08
- Just blow-darted me, you know?
8:10
- AUDIENCE: [laughing]
8:12
- Took my phone, gave himself five stars.
8:15
Those drivers be thirsty. - AUDIENCE: [laughing]
8:17
- I was trying to smash a couple, though, honestly.
8:20
They were cute! This one time,
8:22
I got in the car, like, I got really close.
8:24
Get in the car, we were like, flirting, making small talk,
8:26
he's like, "Where are you coming from?" I was like, "A show,"
8:28
and he's like, "Oh, what instrument do you play?"
8:30
and I was like, "The voice."
8:31
- AUDIENCE: [laughing]
8:33
- But I--"No, I do stand-up or whatever,"
8:35
and I say "or whatever" so he thinks that I'm humble.
8:37
- AUDIENCE: [laughing]
8:39
- And then he goes, "Oh, my God, like, I love stand-up,
8:42
"I've written a couple jokes but I'm a little nervous
8:44
to get onstage and try it,"
8:45
and I was like, "Oh, my God, you seem like
8:47
you have such a natural stage presence."
8:49
- AUDIENCE: [laughing]
8:53
- But he was, like, cute, so I was like, "You know what?
8:55
"How about you just, like,
8:57
"tell me a joke right now in the car,
8:58
and we can just work on it together,"
9:00
he was like, "You sure? I don't wanna waste your time,"
9:02
I was like, "No, go for it,"
9:04
and he's like, "Okay, okay, so, uh, me and my girlfriend--"
9:06
I was like, "Needs work."
9:07
- AUDIENCE: [laughing]
9:14
- "Right here is fine, actually, uh...
9:17
You ain't gotta slow down, I'll just roll, that's cool."
9:19
- AUDIENCE: [laughing]
9:21
- No. I'm very addicted to technology,
9:24
it's like-- it's kind of a problem.
9:25
I realized I was addicted to technology when I got robbed
9:28
and this dude was like, "Is your phone worth your life?"
9:30
and I was like, "Hmm..."
9:32
- AUDIENCE: [laughing]
9:36
- And then I stole his phone.
9:37
- AUDIENCE: [laughing]
9:39
- Right away, and followed myself on Twitter
9:41
from his phone, which was cool.
9:44
The thing that makes me saddest about technology, though,
9:46
is like, there's so many jobs that are just disappearing,
9:49
and it's like, what's gonna happen
9:50
to the bootleg DVD salesman? You know?
9:53
And that makes me so sad 'cause I used to love
9:56
watching bootleg DVDs,
9:58
'cause it's like whenever you were watching
9:59
you're never alone, 'cause, like, you're watching it
10:01
with that person, you know?
10:03
- AUDIENCE: [laughing]
10:04
- You'd be in the middle of the movie, you just hear,
10:07
"Ha-ha-ha-ha! That boy Nemo 'bout crazy as hell!"
10:12
- AUDIENCE: [laughing]
10:15
- And I'd be like, "Damn, Nemo is crazy."
10:18
- AUDIENCE: [laughing]
10:21
- "Didn't even realize that 'til just now." [laughs]
10:25
But I do--I love, like, learning about sciences,
10:29
learning about tech, stuff like that.
10:31
Um...one of my favorite things to do is to research
10:35
which animals are gay.
10:37
- AUDIENCE: [laughing] - Um...giraffes, bi as [bleep].
10:40
- AUDIENCE: [laughing] - Something 'bout the neck,
10:42
we don't know. - AUDIENCE: [laughing]
10:43
- But there's not that much research done about
10:45
which bugs are gay, right?
10:48
I've looked it up-- I've done my own,
10:50
and they say that sometimes, like, two male bugs will, like,
10:52
mistake each other for a female and accidentally have sex,
10:56
and it's like, "Okay, I went to college," um...
10:59
- AUDIENCE: [laughing]
11:02
- So, I made a slide that's a very comprehensive list
11:04
of which bugs are gay or not, so let's go.
11:07
Um, dragonflies, the fact that dragonflies will just,
11:10
like, hover in air perfectly still like that, not moving?
11:13
Gay. - AUDIENCE: [laughing]
11:16
- That requires classical training, you know?
11:18
Like, they went to drama school.
11:20
Ladybugs--every ladybug is a lesbian.
11:23
- AUDIENCE: [laughing] - Honestly.
11:25
Look, they got this bold lipstick right here, but you--
11:27
if you zoom in, there's Birkenstocks--
11:29
- AUDIENCE: [laughing]
11:31
- On every one of these.
11:33
- AUDIENCE: [laughing]
11:34
- Uh, beetles, lesbians. That's a strap.
11:37
- AUDIENCE: [laughing] [applause]
11:45
- Bees? The fact that you're so willing to hurt someone
11:49
that you would die for it?
11:52
That's gay.
11:53
- AUDIENCE: [laughing] - Like...
11:58
the pettiness that that takes. Very gay--
12:01
and they worship a queen? Like, come on, you know?
12:04
- AUDIENCE: [laughing]
12:06
- Wasps. Wasps are straight.
12:08
- AUDIENCE: [laughing]
12:10
- It's a visceral feeling, I don't need to explain it,
12:12
we all get it,
12:13
and look at that interior design, you know?
12:15
Like, it's just not up to par.
12:17
Butterflies, gay. I mean. Come on.
12:20
You know, they go in the cocoon, college, they pop up,
12:23
they start thottin', you know, classic queer narrative.
12:26
Uh...cicadas, the fact that they just, like,
12:29
take off their clothes and leave it anywhere?
12:30
That's straight, you know? - AUDIENCE: [laughing]
12:32
- It's like, "Pick up after yourself, cicadas."
12:34
Gay!
12:36
- AUDIENCE: [laughing] [applause]
12:37
- Every praying mantis is gay as [bleep], look!
12:41
Like, "Yas!"
12:43
- AUDIENCE: [laughing]
12:45
- [unintelligible]
12:48
- AUDIENCE: [laughing]
12:51
- Scorpions, are they insects? Are they spiders?
12:53
Neither, they're bi. - AUDIENCE: [laughing]
12:58
- Cockroaches are gay because they're everywhere
12:59
and you'll never get rid of them.
13:01
- AUDIENCE: [laughing]
13:03
- Ants--with ants, it's like, you're working so hard...
13:08
what are you hiding?
13:09
- AUDIENCE: [laughing]
13:13
[laughter continues]
13:18
- I just think ants need to do some soul-searching.
13:21
- AUDIENCE: [laughing]
13:22
- And daddy long-legs, gay. - AUDIENCE: [laughing]
13:25
- And that is a complete list of all the bugs that are gay.
13:29
- AUDIENCE: [cheering and applause]
13:31
- I know because I've [bleep] them all.
13:37
- I went to Catholic school growing up,
13:39
so if someone could explain sex to me after the show, uh...
13:41
- AUDIENCE: [laughing] - I'd greatly appreciate it.
13:45
Alright, sex education was basically like,
13:47
we were in the chapel, we're like, talking about sex,
13:51
Sister Jean Patrice is leading it, uh...
13:54
I shouldn't say her name.
13:55
[laughs] - AUDIENCE: [laughing]
13:57
- Sister was leading the... the sex ed talk in the chapel,
14:00
and Jesus is just, like, on the cross, staring at us, um,
14:04
also, Jesus be looking cute as [bleep] in the cross, like,
14:07
honestly, like, highlighter popping, abs right,
14:11
just like...
14:12
- AUDIENCE: [laughing]
14:14
[cheering and applause]
14:15
- Oh, yes, oh! My king of kings!
14:19
- AUDIENCE: [laughing] - [moans]
14:22
- AUDIENCE: [laughing]
14:28
- But the presentation started, Sister took up this cup of water
14:31
and she passed it to a kid and she's like, "Spit in that cup."
14:34
and the kid's like, "No."
14:36
And she's like, "Just spit in it,
14:37
pass it around the room," she spits in it,
14:39
passes it around the room, it gets to the last kid,
14:42
and Sister's like, "Now drink that."
14:44
- AUDIENCE: [laughing]
14:45
- And she's like, "See? Gross, right?
14:47
That's your body when you have sex before marriage."
14:49
- AUDIENCE: [laughing]
14:51
- And at the time, I was like, "That's dumb,
14:53
that's false, that's not scientifically accurate,"
14:56
and then I was in the middle of a hook-up the other day,
14:59
we're both very drunk and I felt drool just hit me in the eye,
15:02
and I was like, "Sister was right."
15:04
- AUDIENCE: [laughing]
15:06
- Shoulda waited 'til gay marriage.
15:08
- AUDIENCE: [laughing]
15:09
- Snatch Jesus would've protected me.
15:11
- AUDIENCE: [laughing]
15:12
- I know he would've.
15:17
I realized I was gay-- I was pretty young,
15:19
I was probably, like, nine or ten, I think,
15:22
other people started realizing it when I was
15:23
at a sixth-grade basketball game and my coach swore,
15:25
and I went, "I literally can't do this anymore!"
15:28
- AUDIENCE: [laughing]
15:31
- Just left the game. - AUDIENCE: [laughing]
15:34
- I feel like my parents always kinda knew, too,
15:36
because, like, my dad would give my brothers advice,
15:38
my dad would tell my brothers, "Find a gal that makes you feel
15:42
like you don't deserve her," which is beautiful, right?
15:45
And then he would look at me and be like, "Don't do cocaine."
15:48
- AUDIENCE: [laughing]
15:54
- But also, like, me and my brothers,
15:56
we grew up so different from each other, like,
15:58
both my brothers are taller than me,
15:59
they're fitter than me,
16:00
they carry themselves with confidence, you know?
16:02
I'm small, pale, I carry myself like an inbred European prince.
16:06
- AUDIENCE: [laughing]
16:09
- I don't really step when I walk,
16:10
I just sort of...glide.
16:12
- AUDIENCE: [laughing]
16:15
- I know I'm not ugly, though, I know that.
16:17
- AUDIENCE: [laughing] - On a one to ten scale,
16:19
I don't think I could model but I could
16:20
definitely end a Republican senator's career, you know?
16:23
- AUDIENCE: [laughing]
16:24
- [unintelligible]
16:27
Might just go to DC,
16:29
take 'em down one dick at a time, you know?
16:31
- AUDIENCE: [laughing]
16:32
- No, uh, I ended up coming out to my family
16:35
not too long ago, and my parents,
16:37
they both had very different reactions.
16:39
My dad probably took it the hardest at first.
16:41
My dad was like, "My God, I can't believe my son is gay,
16:44
I could have a stroke, I could have a heart attack,"
16:46
and I was like, "You're being such a [bleep] queen right now."
16:49
- AUDIENCE: [laughing]
16:51
- "It's kinda my moment and you're hogging the spotlight,
16:54
so fall back," uh...
16:56
- AUDIENCE: [laughing]
16:58
- Our family is Jamaican,
16:59
and homophobia is like, our second best Olympic sport.
17:01
[laughs] - AUDIENCE: [laughing]
17:03
- It's like, bobsledding, boom, you know? Like, they get to...
17:06
The funniest thing that my dad said, though,
17:08
he was like--my brothers
17:09
are recording his reaction, and he was like,
17:11
[Jamaican accent] "You know, you ask your son to go mow
17:14
the lawn and he decides to be gay."
17:16
- AUDIENCE: [laughing]
17:18
- And like, I wanted to be mad,
17:20
but that's exactly what happened, honestly.
17:21
- AUDIENCE: [laughing]
17:23
- He asked me too many times,
17:25
I was like, "I'll go suck a [bleep]!" [fake cries]
17:27
- AUDIENCE: [laughing]
17:28
- "I [bleep] hate it here!" - AUDIENCE: [laughing]
17:35
- My mom was the polar opposite. My mom found out,
17:37
and she text me and she goes, "I love my gay son."
17:40
- AUDIENCE: [laughing]
17:41
- WOMAN: Aww. - Then she started
17:43
saying, "I don't know, maybe I'm gay."
17:44
- AUDIENCE: [laughing]
17:46
- "I love my friends!"
17:49
Me and Sandra have a great relationship,
17:50
maybe we can make something work, I don't know.
17:52
- AUDIENCE: [laughing]
17:55
- It's weird, though, 'cause I told my brothers, uh--
17:57
I have two younger brothers, Javon and Javay,
17:59
we couldn't afford other letters--
18:00
and my younger brother Javon ended up coming out to me as bi
18:04
not too long after, which was shocking, 'cause like,
18:07
another person taking my moment.
18:09
- AUDIENCE: [laughing]
18:11
- But also, my mom had a gay child, a bi child,
18:14
and a straight child,
18:15
so her womb was basically a gay dance club
18:17
that became a Buffalo Wild Wings.
18:19
- AUDIENCE: [laughing]
18:25
- I've a lot of attention right now,
18:26
so I wanna leave you guys on something that I feel
18:29
passionate about, uh,
18:31
I think we need to destigmatize black people screaming
18:33
at the movie theaters.
18:35
- AUDIENCE: [laughing] [cheering and applause]
18:40
- Because white people do a lot of annoying shit
18:42
at the movies, too, you know?
18:44
And I don't wanna be the comedian that's like,
18:46
"Black people are like this,
18:47
but white people... are like this..."
18:51
- AUDIENCE: [laughing]
18:56
- I don't wanna do that. But...
19:00
- AUDIENCE: [laughing]
19:02
- When I saw "Call Me By Your Name" in theaters,
19:05
which... - AUDIENCE: [cheering]
19:07
- ...if you haven't seen, it's basically
19:08
"Brokeback Mountain" with olive oil.
19:10
- AUDIENCE: [laughing]
19:15
- I realized the white equivalent
19:17
of yelling at the movies is during like a very
19:19
prestigious, Oscar-baity drama, you just hear someone
19:23
in the back go... [moans]
19:26
- AUDIENCE: [laughing]
19:29
- That's annoying. - AUDIENCE: [laughing]
19:31
- Whereas on the other end of the spectrum,
19:33
when I saw "Get Out" in theaters, um,
19:35
the scene at the end where old girl is eating
19:37
the cereal out of the cup dry--
19:39
if you haven't seen it, I'm gonna spoil it,
19:40
you're racist, you waited too long.
19:42
- AUDIENCE: [laughing]
19:45
[cheering and applause]
19:49
- The scene at the end where the girl is eating
19:51
cereal out of the cup dry and looking up top NCAA pic,
19:55
this lady in the back went,
19:56
"Bitch, you ain't that cute!"
19:58
- AUDIENCE: [laughing]
20:01
[cheering and applause]
20:03
- And that truly enhanced my movie-going experience,
20:06
you know? - AUDIENCE: [laughing]
20:08
- It's like I get all 4D. - AUDIENCE: [laughing]
20:11
- White people lean out, touching your hair and shit.
20:14
Alright, thank you guys!
20:15
You guys have been great! - [cheering]
20:17
- Thank you!
