Now, after 20 years, I'm back to do my stand-up in front of currently incarcerated folks
0:44
to let the world know that you can do whatever you put your mind to, because it's bigger than these bars.
0:50
(lively music) (audience cheering and applauding)
1:12
First of all, thank y'all for being here. Now, it's not like y'all had a choice or nothing.
1:17
(audience laughs) What you gonna do, sit in your cell or come to a show?
1:24
It's free. You already paid the cost to be here. This is, no... (audience laughs)
1:30
Man, this is my 20th year of being out of the penitentiary.
1:36
Man, I got arrested 20 years ago. (audience applauds)
1:41
I actually came from exactly where you sitting now to where I'm standing now in 20 years.
1:48
It took me that long with patience. I went to jail not too long ago. It's crazy.
1:55
I've been out 20 years and went to jail on the way to take my son to school. You can get caught with four ounces of marijuana,
2:01
it's a ticket, Class B. I read it. Verbatim. Read every sentence of that shit. I know it. It is a ticket, ticket, Class B, ticket.
2:08
So I get pulled over, and the man said, "Can you tell me why is there a strong aroma of marijuana
2:18
coming from your truck?" And I said, I'm being very cavalier 'cause I know the law. I said, "Um, I don't know about strong, but...
2:25
(audience laughs) But it's right there in that little ashtray right there."
2:32
And he's like, "Can you step out of the car?" I'm like, "No. Can you write me a ticket so I can go about my way?
2:38
I'm taking my son to school." Man, you know this man, he done call so many people
2:44
over half a blunt, it look like they done busted El Chapo. (audience laughs)
2:49
So boom, I'm in the back. The man taking me to jail. I get to jail, and I'm very, very cavalier,
2:54
because I'm the spokesperson for a bonding company. Yeah, yeah. I got a bonding company on deck.
3:01
And the commercial says, "Midtown Bail Bond. If you got to jail, we'll get you out."
3:08
So how the hell they gonna leave me in there? I'm the spokesperson. (audience laughs)
3:15
Your goddamn spokesperson can't be walking through jail. "Ain't you the spokesperson?" "Nope. They fired me." It's crazy. (audience laughs)
3:23
Clearly, I'm not gonna be here long at all. And the officer said, "In order to get a bond, you got to see the judge."
3:31
I said, "Well, shit, where the judge at? Let's get it popping." (audience laughs) He said, "I'ma see about you seeing a judge,
3:37
but right now, we need to put you in this holding cell." And when I'm about to walk in the holding cell, the man told me, "Hey, let me get them shoes."
3:45
I say, "What you need my shoes for?" He said, "'Cause we can't have you killing yourself while you in this cell."
3:52
I said, "Brother, let me explain something to you. Y'all busted me for a half a blunt. You should be embarrassed.
3:58
And I am embarrassed for somebody who got busted the first time with five kilos of coke. Now you got me here on a goddamn half a blunt?
4:04
I'm ashamed of me and you." (audience laughs) (soft tense music)
4:13
- Hey. What's happening? - So really. - Can I get up here? Out of respect, where you want me to sit?
4:18
I don't want to be on your pillow. I mean, this is hers. - Whose bunk? - Help yourself. - Jail rules, I don't wanna be disrespectful.
4:24
(all laughing) Has anybody in here ever been to prison?
4:31
- I've been. Went TDC plus treatment. What grabbed me really about your act tonight
4:36
was the fact that you said, even after 20 years, you found yourself back in that same situation.
4:44
Well, after 20-plus years, I found myself in the same situation, which is right here.
4:53
I graduated from that program, went to college, got a degree, went back and worked at the same facility
4:59
in which I was an inmate, so... - Get out of Dodge. - And once again, here I am.
5:05
Like I used to tell my clients, it's a matter of timing and circumstances,
5:11
basically, is what it is, timing, circumstances, and your choices. - How you feel your body holding up here?
5:19
This is not a, it's not a lot. It's not a lot of cushion. I feel every crook, every cranny.
5:25
(all laughing) (soft tense music)
5:32
- Man, when I was in that cell, my body has not recovered from that one night in jail.
5:40
Everything hurt. Back hurt. And I'm a pretty fit athlete, 'cause me, I try to stay fit.
5:49
I play in the over 40 basketball league. I was MVP two years in a row.
5:56
Yeah, 41 and 42. (audience laughs) I got cocky, I took my MVP game down to the gym,
6:03
the real gym where young boys play, 'cause when you in the over 40 league, it's easy, it's easy.
6:11
You quick. You out there doing your thing. And people over 40 got respect. When somebody hit a shot on you,
6:17
they just run down the court, and they look at you. "That's it, boy, gotcha." That's it. Young boys are disrespectful.
6:24
They disrespectful at that gym. So, I'm down, I'm at the gym, and I got my situation down. You know what I'm saying?
6:30
My defense is tight on this young boy. I'm right here with it. Man, this little young boy crossed me over so fast that I...
6:37
Let me tell you something. I know y'all know what a crossover is. I know you know what a crossover is, when somebody go this way and then cut back this way real fast with the ball.
6:45
The man crossed me over so fast that I just went to the water fountain. (audience laughs)
6:52
I had to ask other people. I said, "Did you see him? Did you see him?" The dude say, "Man, you just got AI'd."
6:58
I said, "AI'd? What the hell is AI'd?" This dude say, "Hey, man, remember when Allen Iverson crossed over Jordan?"
7:06
I said, "Yeah." He said, "Yeah. That's AI'd." I said, "I'd be damned you gonna cross me over and give me a nickname out here, I be goddamned."
7:13
(audience laughs) And see, the young boy disrespectful, man. He disrespectful. I'm running down the court. He's next to me.
7:18
"Yeah, boy. Yeah. You just got AI'd, boy." (audience laughs)
7:23
So people don't remember the very next play, very next play, Jordan came down, hit a long-range jumper
7:29
in Allen Iverson's face very next play. I say, "Yeah, that's what I'm gonna do.
7:34
That's what I'm gonna do. Ball up. Ball up. Ball up. Ball up." Ran up on the young boy. Uh! Long-range jumper.
7:41
Shot the ball, hit the jumper. Back went out. (audience laughs)
7:48
Man, I'm going out the damn gym in a stretcher. (audience laughs)
7:55
"Wait, oh..." When they about to wheel me out, I say, "Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
8:00
My son's in the daycare. My son's in the daycare." So they had to go to the daycare and find my son.
8:05
And my son, I can't help them 'cause I'm on the stretcher already. So the paramedics just picking up random black kids,
8:10
showing them to me. "This your baby right here, this your? (audience laughs) What about this one? This yours? This yours right here?"
8:17
And I know it took 20 minutes, 'cause my son ain't going to let nobody just grab him. This boy go running, sliding, fighting 'em.
8:23
So they finally get my son, finally get my son, put my son on my chest.
8:29
Now I'm getting rolled out of the gym like a goddamn NFL player. (audience laughs)
8:39
Do you know when you go out a gym on a stretcher,
8:49
you know you can never go back to that gym again? (audience laughs) Do you know that?
8:55
Six months later, man, I walked in that gym, and the dude is like, "Ooh, there goes stretcher man." I said, "I'm not no goddamn stretcher man."
9:01
(audience laughs) Yo, yo, yo, what's up fellas? What's good, man? What's up, gentlemen? - All good.
9:08
- What's up, man? Gentlemen, gentlemen. Most people don't know that I was incarcerated for six years.
9:13
Most people don't know that. That's why I came back to do my special here 'cause most people don't realize that jail is not just physical, it's mental.
9:22
It's a mental thing. I don't never try to forget this place. Never. That's when I was in for, thinking I was invincible.
9:31
One thing I've been trying to forget, my SPN number. - Can't.
9:37
- Can't. One time, I thought I forgot it, and it popped right back in my head.
9:44
(inmate chuckles) 679346. - Mm. - 671250.
9:51
- 871415. - 334252. - 2128235.
9:57
- Mental is way more destructive than physical,
10:04
'cause they ain't physically put that number on none of us. Ain't nowhere on your skin you can look at it,
10:09
but they burnt it in your brain. - Yeah. - Real talk. Real talk. Once they gave it to me,
10:15
it's like what you just said. Sometimes you can't even remember your Social Security number. - Your own name.
10:21
- Your whole name, but you know that number, 'cause that's the main thing what they go by, that number,
10:27
so you got to remember that number. And that's cold-blooded, man. - You're no different than somebody who been at war,
10:34
the post-traumatic stress. - Got it. - Man, I been out for 20 years,
10:40
and you think that, oh, it's no effects. I'm the same as everybody here. I'm the exact same.
10:46
It's ups and downs with me. It's mental challenges with me. If I see myself getting loud in an argument,
10:56
let me walk off, 'cause I already know where it's gonna go. I want to be mentally free
11:03
so I can stay physically free. - Mm-hmm. (lively music)
11:12
- See, there's a difference between jail and prison, totally different, totally different.
11:19
Jail, you got a lot of hopes that you gonna get out of here. Prison, you sign for what you're going to sign for.
11:26
You gotta start walking your walk, locking your mind in. Been out 20 years, man. You know I still go in the bathroom of my own house,
11:33
go in the bathroom, sit down, and turn that water on so I can have some noise.
11:39
(audience laughs) Disrespect is the number-one thing
11:45
they do out there in society. And anything... Like, me, this what I find disrespectful.
11:51
'Cause I don't like lines, man. I don't like lines, and that's a direct effect from being in prison.
11:58
I don't like lines at all. I don't like people standing close to me, and they disrespectful.
12:03
This is how much space I give you. If I'm behind you in line,
12:10
I'ma give you this much space in the free society. You may wanna start fucking salsaing.
12:15
I'm not finna be in your way. I'ma give you this much space. People in the free society,
12:22
they up on you like this. And you be like, "Say, man, can you back the fuck up a little bit, man?"
12:28
(audience laughs) People in the free society, they don't give a shit about no space.
12:34
Soon as you move, they... (audience laughs) Ever been to the grocery store?
12:39
You in line. You stand like a normal human. They come up like... I know damn well...
12:44
(audience laughs) I know damn well my man ain't up on me like that. (audience laughs)
12:50
And you, as a normal human being, you try to scoot up a little bit, you know? Okay. I'm normal. I'm cool.
12:55
Soon as you move up... (audience laughs)
13:01
I tested this dude one time. I was going to see how deep he was gonna go. I stepped to the side.
13:07
This mother came right behind me. I said, "Man, get your ass back over there. Follow me around this damn grocery store."
13:13
(audience laughs) So I'm going to tell you why I don't like lines, man,
13:18
'cause when you locked up, there's some gates, man. And before you go in that cell, they say, "Take your white off. Just keep your boxers on."
13:27
So you move to this gate, and they packing people in here. They packing people in.
13:32
You don't want anybody up on you. You're like, "Hey, man, give me some space. All this me right here. All this me."
13:37
So then you a rational person. You understand that if I had clothes on over there,
13:44
I have boxers on right here. It's another gate.
13:50
Yeah, I'm gonna end up naked over there. I can see this coming. (audience laughs) I can see the process coming.
13:55
So next gate, they process. You come to the next gate. Soon as you go, he's like, "Let me get them boxers."
14:03
So now you damn sure don't want nobody talking to you now. You want all your space because you're naked. This is your first time that you like, "Yo, all this me right here."
14:10
Dude is talking to you. "Hey, man, what you in here for?" Killing motherfuckers who talking to me naked! Get your ass away from me! (audience laughs)
14:17
Don't want nobody talking to me, man. And then shit getting worse 'cause you come out. Man, in the line, they taking people out,
14:23
and you hearing it. You hearing it. You ain't paying attention. You hearing, "Heel to toe, heel to toe!" Now, if this your first rodeo,
14:30
and you don't know what heel to toe is... So this is a person. They want you to come out, put your heels,
14:39
put your toes on their heels. I walked out. I ain't know what they mean. I just stood in line. Man say, "Scoot up. We don't want no gaps in the line."
14:48
(audience laughs) He say, "Man, all the way up, heel to toe!"
14:55
Mm-hmm. I said, "I can't stand up like that. How you supposed to stand up like that?"
15:03
I said, "I can't stand up like that." He said, "Go up!
15:09
Turn around!
15:14
Put your toes on..." So I'm standing like this.
15:19
I'm leaning on the dude in front of me like. I say, "Hey, dawg, no disrespect.
15:25
I'm gonna just lean right here, 'cause I don't want my meat all up on you, I'm good." (audience laughs)
15:31
Man, he brought some more people. I said, "Hold on, man." (audience laughs)
15:37
He brought two more people. I slid out of line. Y'all go up.
15:43
I'm going to be in the back, man, going to be in the back. That man came back and said, "Did you move?"
15:49
I said, "Yeah, 'cause you brought two more people, and they looked like they was very comfortable
15:54
with the heel to toe, and I just want to hold the back down if that's cool with you." He said, "Man, don't move no more."
15:59
I said, "Well, don't bring no more people." (audience laughs) Officer said, "Boy, if you move again,
16:07
we gonna beat you." And, see, I'm one of the people, you got to prove that to me.
16:12
I'm like, "Yeah, whatever." Soon as that man left, he brought another person.
16:19
Soon as he left, I said, "Man, go on up. I'm going to hold the back down.
16:24
I been in the back. I'm gonna stay in the back." (audience laughs)
16:29
Them officers took me in the back. They wore me out a little bit. They beat me down. So they brought me back. I'm raggedy. I'm raggedy.
16:37
And they put me back in the line, so I'm in line, and they got me heel to toe,
16:42
got me heel to toe, but I'm so resilient that I done turn, my feet still stable,
16:48
but I done turned my whole body this way. I'm standing like this, and the officer come by.
16:53
He said, "Yeah, as long as your ass don't move." I said, "Hey, long as I got penises on my side,
16:58
not on my ass, I'm good." (audience laughs) (lively music)
17:06
Look, I really believe, man, that they should do intake, they should do the whole process in high schools, right,
17:12
from whenever you get to 10th grade, 10th on up, 10th, every year. - 9th grade. - Oh, you say 9th? - 9th grade.
17:18
- 9th grade. You start intake in 9th grade. Man, I'm going to tell you nobody go to prison. Soon as you come in here,
17:24
"Hey, get your books. I need you heel to toe." (all laughing)
17:30
- Put your backpack on. - Yeah, just your backpack on, naked with your backpack on. (group laughing)
17:37
(groovy music) Anybody can go be locked up for anything,
17:44
any day, any particular reason. 'Cause let me tell you what don't ever happen.
17:49
Don't nobody plan on going to jail. That ain't what you do.
17:54
You don't put your shoes on and plan your day, say, I'm gonna go to the bank, I'ma run by this little chick house,
18:01
then I'm gonna go to jail around 2:30, four o'clock. (audience laughs)
18:06
Anybody can go to jail on any given day. You know you one drink and most people out there are one drink away
18:13
from ending up in jail. I don't drink dark liquor at all. Don't drink dark liquor.
18:19
If I'm gonna drink anything, and I don't really drink, but if I'm going to drink, I'm gonna drink a margarita. That's it, margarita, and I want it frozen.
18:26
I want a frozen margarita with sugar, salt on the top with all the fruit in the world in it and two straws,
18:32
and I'm going to walk through the club just like this. You ain't never seen nobody with a margarita frowning.
18:39
Margarita's a happy drink. Even if you are frowning, I can put a margarita in your hand. You... (audience laughs)
18:46
Nobody goes to jail on a margarita. They sell you a pitcher of margarita. Do they sell you a pitcher of Hennessey? Hell no.
18:54
(audience laughs) If you buy a pitcher of Hennessey, you going straight to prison. You going to skip jail. You just going to just wind up in prison,
19:00
like, "Man, how I get here?" "You drank a pitcher of Hennessey!" (audience laughs) Dark liquor and attitude get your ass in trouble.
19:08
So we coming out the club. My cousin talking loud, X, Y, and Z, and the officer says, "Hey, brother. Hey, brother.
19:17
Can you lower your voice?" Because he's being loud and belligerent. And we were. We were.
19:23
You know what I'm saying, because we're happy. My cousin wanna stand right by the officer and talk shit.
19:29
He say, "Hey, man, don't tell me how to talk and how loud to talk," and stepped towards the officer.
19:35
The officer said, "Hey, hey, boy... (audience laughs) Don't do that. Don't take another step toward me,
19:42
'cause I'm gonna stun-gun your ass." My cousin, on that liquor, "Hey, the hell you mean you gonna stun-gun me?"
19:48
Margaritas. Margaritas. I got good understanding. I'm margarita. I stay down. I say, "Hey, stun gun, means he's going to electrocute you, dawg.
19:54
He's about to electrocute you. That's what he's trying to do. Electrocution is about to happen, son." (audience laughs) My cousin, but I knew what happen.
20:01
My cousin in a fraternity, and that man said don't step towards him. And I know that's all my cousin heard
20:07
was don't step, 'cause his response was, "Man, don't tell me not to goddamn step. I'll step on over this bitch!"
20:15
As soon as he spun around, that man stun-gunned his ass. (audience laughs) And what I'm mad about, my cousin gonna grab me,
20:22
and now we both... (audience laughs) (lively music)
20:27
How you doing, sir? Good to see you, man. I'm talking to the top man around this piece, El Capitan.
20:35
Can anyone go to jail? - Everybody can come to jail. It doesn't discriminate against anybody.
20:41
- Rich to poor. - Police officers, school teachers, nurses, attorneys.
20:46
- Politicians. - Clergymen. Anybody come to jail. - Anybody. - Anybody come to jail.
20:51
And that's what we try to teach staff, the script can flip. You may be jail today, you can be inmate tomorrow. - So I come in drunk... - Okay.
20:58
- I come in drunk, wired. What happens after I get inside? - If somebody comes in intoxicated,
21:04
you may be a little bit obnoxious. You'd probably talk a little noise to me.
21:09
But the key thing is to treat you right. Some folks come in, they done defecated on themselves,
21:14
they urinate on themselves. So yeah, to be able to deal with that, that's kinda different though. 'Cause that don't normally happen to folks, right?
21:20
Would it ever happen to you? - Hey, only one person ever pooted in my face, now my son,
21:26
like right in my face, I'd beat the baby. (both laughing) (lively music)
21:31
I served six years in prison for drug trafficking. Some of y'all can probably relate to that.
21:37
Some of y'all, not looking at nobody in particular. Man, what you in here for? - Assault.
21:42
- Assault? When you got here, was you liquored up? - Yeah. - Yeah, so they got a tape on you
21:48
in that intake going wild. - No. - If I asked the people to run back your video,
21:54
it's gonna just you be... This is what I'ma see. I'ma just see you walking in pleasant.
22:00
"This is where I sit? Okay." - Mm-mm. - That's what? No. - 'Cause see, usually it comes like this. "I don't a give a sh, yo, yo! It ain't me, it ain't me!
22:08
He put his hands on me first!" (all laughing) (lively music)
22:14
I used to drink Hennessey. Let me tell you, I used to drink Hennessey heavy, never had a single shot of Hennessey, not one single shot, always had doubles.
22:21
So go to happy hour. I'm in happy hour, drinking dark liquor. I'm 10 Hennesseys in.
22:28
Yeah, 10 of 'em. Can't make no good decisions now. 10. Hennessey taking over my life.
22:33
Dude bump into me. Normal mind, a normal human being, you in the club, the club is packed.
22:39
People gonna bump into each other. Man bumped into me, made me spill Hennessey on my shirt.
22:45
Normal mind, you know, this is nothing, people bumping into people. That Hennessey said, "Nah.
22:51
(audience laughs) (audience applauds)
22:56
No. He being disrespectful. He being disrespectful,
23:02
and you should tell him." So I went and told the dude. I say, "Say, my man, say, my man, say, my man,
23:09
you being disrespectful, dawg. You being disrespectful." Dude told me, too. He said, "Go on on, little dawg.
23:14
(audience laughs) Go on, little dawg. Go on on."
23:20
I would've went on. My normal mind, I'd have just went on, I'd just went on. But that Hennessey said, "No.
23:26
(audience laughs) You should swing on him. You should swing on him."
23:33
Man, I swung with that man. That man whooped my ass 'cause I was drunk. Let me tell you how I know I got my ass whooped, 'cause my shoe came off, my shoe came off.
23:40
You know how embarrassing it is to be walking in a club looking for your shoe? I was like, "Shit, I wasn't even over here."
23:46
This lady came and gave me my shoe. "Here go your shoe." I said, "Gimme my goddamn shoe."
23:51
She say, "You better go on, little dawg." I went on that time. No two ass whooping for me in one night. (audience laughs) But see, I got pride.
23:57
My pride, though. My pride. That man whooped me, that man whooped me about 12:15. So I got time. I got time to go to my truck and sober up.
24:05
I got time. I got time 'cause the club don't close till 2:30. I got time. I'm trying to sober myself up.
24:11
Yeah, get it together. Get it together. Get it together. Around 2:30, that man walk out of that club.
24:17
He drunk now. He drunk now. I'm right there. And I knew I was wrong when I walked up. I say, "Hey, remember me?
24:22
You whooped my ass around 12:15. I'm back." Whooped that man's ass right there in front of that club, knocked his ass smooth out.
24:28
But I'm so petty. I'm so petty. I'm so petty. His shoes didn't come off. I'm mad 'cause his shoes didn't come off.
24:34
So I took his shoes off and threw the motherfuckers two different directions. (audience laughs) He'll find them when he get up. Fuck it.
24:40
(audience laughs) Is it a lot of fighting in jail?
24:45
- Absolutely. It's just little petty shit that wouldn't really bother you, but it's gonna set you off like that.
24:52
- I don't think there's many ways here to release your anger. You're already frustrated. Somebody come up to you talking crazy,
24:57
normally on a good day you'd be like, "Man, go on ahead." But that one day when you got everything else going wrong and somebody come at you crazy and just...
25:04
(Ali mimics punching) You regret it afterwards 'cause you're like, "I probably shouldn't have
25:09
took my anger out on them like that." But I mean, it's sad to say, but you feel better. It's like...
25:16
I mean, I'm just being honest. I felt better. - The thing that saved me a lot was pushups.
25:22
After you do 100 pushups, you really kinda don't wanna fight no more. You're just like, "Nah, I'm cool."
25:28
(all laughing) Pushups was a lot of therapy for me. If it wasn't for pushups, I'd probably did a lot worse.
25:36
(lively music)
25:42
I done fought a lot. I done had a lot of fights. You look at my face, I got all type of scars and scratches. I done earned each and every last one of 'em.
25:48
Now, I ain't never been bullied. I had a good mama. I had a good parent that said, "Hey, ain't no bullying in life for us, baby.
25:56
You gonna be too small to get bullied. You gonna be tough." My mama grab me. I'm about six years old.
26:01
I'm walking through the house. My mama grabbed me by my shirt. "Hey, boy, let me tell you something. Either you fight in the street or you fight me."
26:08
I'm like, "Shit, what you heard? I'm six." (audience laughs) (Ali laughs)
26:15
So you learn that you gonna fight. I never got bullied, man. Let me tell you a story. I'm at the basketball court.
26:20
Me and this dude get into it. I beat him up. His three brothers come back, jump on me, beat me up.
26:27
I go home. I go home. I'm sitting on the couch. My mom walked in. "Hey, boy, what's wrong with you?"
26:33
I say, "Um, these three boys jumped on me at the basketball court, you know what I'm saying?" She said, "Shit, they damn sure whooped your ass,
26:42
got you in here looking like Cuba Gooding Jr. in 'Boyz n the Hood' after Rickie got killed." If you never saw the movie, that mean I had blood all over.
26:50
So my mama told my sister, "Hey, go get my purse. We about to go back down there."
26:56
And I'm sitting there like this. "I don't wanna go back down there. (audience laughs)
27:01
I just told you they jumping on people down there. I just told you that." My mama said, "Get your ass up, boy." You know how embarrassing it is
27:07
to walk to a fight with your mama and your sister? You don't even want to go. You're walking slow.
27:12
(audience laughs) "Bring your ass on here." Get down there. Mama's like, "Point 'em out!"
27:20
(audience laughs) My mama got them boys together.
27:27
"Come here, you little ignorant ass boy. Let me tell you something. You don't jump on my damn son. You wanna fight my son, fight my son right now, one-on-one."
27:32
I was like this. (audience laughs) (audience applauds)
27:38
Five fights in one day? I told my mama, "To the side. Let me talk to you.
27:44
Let me talk to you. Let me talk to you." I told my mama, "Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, I thought you was coming down here to fight."
27:51
I say, "What is in your purse? 'Cause we gonna need it. Whatever's in your purse, we gonna need it." My mama, she made me fight them boys,
27:58
made me fight them boys. I beat up two of 'em and lost the third fight
28:04
out of pure exhaustion. Don't nobody have no goddamn five fights in one day. (audience laughs)
28:11
I lost another fight 'cause of my mama, man. When you a parent, you have to give complete information.
28:17
Don't give your kids no half-ass information. We're in a room, me, my cousins and my sisters,
28:23
we in there fighting, whatever. My mama busting, "Hey, no hitting in the face!
28:29
You don't hit nobody in they face!" Cut two, I'm outside getting to it with this dude.
28:37
We're about to start fighting. Dude said, "You wanna fight?" "Yeah, I'll fight you." Boom, I'm up with it. Boom, hit the dude in the chest.
28:42
Boom, dude hit me in the face. I say, "Hey, hey man, hey... Hey, no hitting in the face.
28:47
(audience laughs) Nah, no hitting in the face. You don't hit nobody in the face."
28:54
I said, "Man, come on, you wanna fight, come on, get with it." Bow, dude hit me in the face. I said, "I quit, 'cause you don't know how to fight right. (audience laughs)
29:01
I go home, I'm sitting on the couch. My mama look at me, "Boy, what's wrong with your eye?" I said, "I'm down there, me and this dude get into it,
29:10
he don't know how to fight, he hit me in the damn face." My mama said, "Well, why you didn't hit him back in the face?"
29:16
I said, "'Cause you told me no hitting in the face." (audience laughs) She said, "No boy, that's your sisters and your cousins.
29:24
You can hit anybody else in the face." I said, "Well, get your purse and let's go back down there." (audience laughs)
29:32
- My name is Earlene Williams, and I'm a building sergeant. - Have you housed the same person multiple times?
29:38
- Yes. - How many days, the shortest to the longest? - Mm, one day, one day.
29:44
You always get PIs. Got out- Public intoxication, okay. - Went down the street, opened a can of beer,
29:50
drunk it, and then called the cops on him, came back. - Okay. - 'Cause he went in the store. He didn't purchase it, so he went in, just opened the can.
29:56
- Oh, so he stole it? - Yeah, stole it and drank it, and he knew the cop was coming, and he came right back. - He didn't wanna go home. - No.
30:01
- Y'all pushed him out the door. He like, "No! No!" And he's like, "All right, all right. Respect, respect.
30:08
That's how y'all feel? All right." Walk in the store. Pop. Yeah. - And come right back. - Came back, hugged you.
30:14
- No, he ain't hug me. - "Williams, I'm back, boo!" - No. (both laughing) (lively music)
30:22
Do you know that you can end up in jail trying to get clarity on something?
30:28
You trying to get clarity, and you end up in jail. Let me ask you all a question. Say you marry a woman, you marry a woman,
30:35
then you find out this woman can't have kids, find out she can't have kids. But you love the woman so much
30:43
that she convinces you to adopt, and y'all do, y'all adopt, y'all adopt.
30:51
And then y'all get divorced. (audience laughs)
30:57
Do you owe child support on that baby? (audience laughs)
31:02
When I asked the women, the women was like, "Yes." I looked at y'all, y'all like, "Nah."
31:08
(audience laughs) "That ain't your baby like that, dawg. That ain't your baby like that."
31:13
(Ali laughs) (audience laughs) But if you go to court,
31:18
the judge is going to say, "Hey, this is your baby. (audience laughs)
31:24
And you are financially responsible for this baby!" But let me tell you what not to yell out,
31:33
once that judge gives you clarity. Don't say this. "Well, if it's my baby, show me the blood work!"
31:41
Don't say that. Don't say that. They gonna hold you in contempt. They gonna hold you in contempt.
31:46
And when they hold you in contempt, you heard that judge say that you was in contempt. You heard it, and you could've just walked to that little contempt door and just went on over there,
31:53
but you going to stand there like you ain't hear that man talking to you, 'cause you, and you a good person, you a good person.
31:59
You a good person. You know what I'm saying? You take care of your mama when you can. You know what I'm saying?
32:04
You go to church. You pay your tithes. You're educated. You're educated. But when that judge holds you in contempt,
32:10
and you standing there, a bailiff is gonna come touch you, and you gonna forget that you a good person.
32:17
You gonna forget you a good person. And when that bailiff touch you, you not gonna respond like a good person.
32:22
You gonna respond a little bit something like this. "Get your goddamn hands off me!"
32:27
And then more bailiffs are going to come, and then they gonna drag you out. They gonna drag you out.
32:33
And when they drag you out, they always manage to grab your face like that. They always manage to do that.
32:38
So let me tell y'all why I come in, 'cause this is my cousin's situation. This is not my situation. I'm in court just being down.
32:45
When you tell somebody that you gonna be down with them, you gonna have to prove that. I'm in court
32:52
being down with my cousin, being supportive. And then this contempt shit starts to happen.
32:59
And now I have to reevaluate... (audience laughs)
33:05
how down I'm gonna be, because this is the problem. This is the problem. They dragging him out. When they drag him out,
33:11
you try to look at the person who said that they down with you, who in there for your support. I saw him try to get his neck around.
33:16
I saw him. He try to get his neck around. I saw him. I saw him. But I'm wondering, like, "Why the hell you looking at me? Don't draw no attention to me."
33:22
(audience laughs) You ever been in the car with somebody, and they get stopped in a traffic violation?
33:28
And you sitting there minding your own business, minding your own business. The officer doing his business, then he come around to your window and say,
33:35
"Um, can I have your ID?" "No. What the hell you need my goddamn ID for?
33:40
I'm not driving. I'm sitting. Is it a sitting ticket?" (audience laughs) I asked the man one time.
33:46
I said, "Hey, man, what do you need to see my ID for?" He say, "Just in case we take him to jail."
33:52
I say, "Well, take him to jail first, decide that first, and then we'll cross that bridge when we get to it on my ID."
33:58
(audience laughs) Every time I give them folk to my ID, I go to jail. I don't know what's on my ID.
34:03
(audience laughs) I don't know what's on my ID. I don't trust my ID. Shit, no. (audience laughs)
34:11
I don't trust my ID, man. I'm telling you, man. (audience applauds) That motherfucka rat me, dawg, (audience applauds)
34:17
Ooh-whoo, 'cause I asked him. I said, "Hey, man. Even if you take him to jail,
34:22
what do you need to see my ID for?" He said, "We need to make sure that you are authorized
34:29
to operate a motor vehicle." I said, "Man, this not my vehicle. I got it, I'll walk. I ain't got time for this.
34:35
(audience laughs) This is not my vehicle, man. This is not my vehicle."
34:40
I told the boy, I say, "Hey, when y'all done with y'all business, pick me up. I'ma be walking this way." (audience laughs)
34:48
Man, so, my cousin looking at me. The bailiff saw where his eyes was looking,
34:54
so the bailiff gonna come on the row that I'm on, 'cause he tracked his eyes. He said, "Um, is anybody with him?"
35:02
Shit, I spoke up for the whole row. I said, "Hell, no. (audience laughs) Ain't nobody with contempt, man. Hell, no."
35:10
You know my cousin mad at me? This what he mad at me for, 'cause he tried to look at me, and this is what I did. He tried to look at me.
35:17
(audience laughs) He gonna tell my mama, gonna tell my mama on me.
35:22
My mama said, "Um, well, he is like that." (audience laughs)
35:27
I said, "What you mean I'm like that?" I know what my mama meant, though. I know exactly what she meant. Let me tell you something.
35:34
I got my mama arrested. Got my mama arrested. Accident, accident. Don't judge. Accident.
35:40
See, I don't like being late for nothing. I'm never late, so my mama asked to use my truck
35:45
while I'm out of town. I said, "Hey, if you want to use my truck, come pick me up, take me to the airport. I got somewhere to be, and don't be late."
35:53
You know my mama show up late? Now we rushing. We rushing to the airport, and it's an accident,
35:58
and I ain't got no time for no accident. So I tell my mama, "Go around, go around the accident, go around."
36:05
I didn't know that you couldn't do that. I didn't know that you couldn't go around accidents. So the cop pulled us over, yelling at my mama, and he said,
36:12
"Ma'am, did you not see that there was an accident?" My mama said, "Yeah, I saw there was an accident.
36:18
That's why I went around." Then the man said, "You could've ran over a body, ma'am!
36:24
You could've ran over a body!" Now I'm hot. Now I'm hot 'cause I'm late. I'm running late.
36:30
I ain't got time for this shit. So I said, "Hey, but did we run over a body, sir?
36:36
Did we run over a body?" But the man, he didn't see me. He thought that was my mama talking.
36:42
(audience laughs) So my mama gonna look at me, and I act like I was sleep. (audience laughs)
36:51
Officer came and knocked on the window, I woke up with my ID in my hand. I said, "I am authorized to operate a motor vehicle, sir."
36:57
(audience laughs) What were you in for? - Theft.
37:02
- Theft. Bank robbery or theft? - Scamming. - Now let me tell you about that, scamming from banks.
37:10
I used to be, you know, "This is you, Mr. Martinez?" "Si."
37:15
(all laughing) So I get out, get out, done, done with crime.
37:21
Ain't did that in a while. You know the effects of past crimes I did, I'm skeptical. I'm in the bank, years, in there,
37:29
gave that man my check with my name on it and my ID.
37:36
That lady said, "We gotta take this to the back." The first thing come to my mind, "They remember I used to write these checks
37:42
back in the day, they try to set me up" (group laughing) They was the back with my ID, I said, "That lady got 10 Mississippis
37:49
(group laughing) until I'm out of here." I'm on six Mississippis. I'm out the door.
37:55
I go, "I can't take it." The lady comes out with my money. She's like, "Sir, here go your money."
38:00
I'm like, "Uh-uh. Put it in my account." I'm gone, I'm out of here. (group laughing) (lively music)
38:07
I get speeding tickets all the time. You can't give me no speeding ticket in September and give me a court date for December
38:14
and think I'm gonna remember the shit. I'm gonna end up with a warrant. You know how long my license was suspended?
38:20
My license was suspended for five years before I got it corrected. I had the money, was being rebellious.
38:27
I get a no-insurance ticket on the way to renew my insurance. Crazy. So I paid the ticket.
38:33
The ticket was $362, no-insurance ticket. But three months later, I paid the ticket.
38:38
They send me a goddamn surcharge letter, $292,
38:45
and they say I got to pay that shit for three years. I call office, thinking there's a mistake. "Hey, what's happening, department of whatever y'all doing.
38:53
(audience laughs) I got a surcharge that I paid my insurance." Said, "Yeah, that's new. We doing surcharges."
38:59
I said, "No. I didn't vote for that, if y'all put that in. I didn't vote for that." (audience laughs)
39:04
And then, lady said, "Well, if you don't pay it, we gonna suspend your license." And you know what I said?
39:10
"Well, suspend the motherfucka then." (audience laughs) Hung up, hung up.
39:16
My license was no good after that. It was no good. I didn't know. I'm driving.
39:22
I get stopped by one of them state troopers. Now I got to go into full Oscar mode.
39:29
I was a white woman for five years. Five years, best white woman you ever will see,
39:36
get pulled over. "Dude, can I see your ID?" "Oh, no problem. Here you go. Take that." Boom.
39:41
Went to the back, I already know what's going to happen. That man come up, boom. "Sir, do you know that your license is suspended?"
39:50
Oh, no problem for me. I'm finna go into white woman. Here I go. (Ali gasps)
39:55
"Are you serious? (audience laughs)
40:01
Why would my license be suspended?" Gave me the whole shebang, the surcharge,
40:06
gave me the whole speech, and I'm acting so interested. "There's a surcharge? Oh, my God. When did this come about?"
40:13
(audience laughs) Boom. Let me go on a warning. Let me go on a warning.
40:18
Yeah, let me go on a warning. (audience applauds)
40:27
For five years, I been turning with this, (Ali gasps) (audience laughs)
40:34
"Are you serious?" Five years.
40:39
Speeding again, get stopped by a trooper. I don't give two shits 'cause I'm ready,
40:45

40:51
Boom. The man stop me. "Can I see your license?" I'm so good. I'm so confident, I had my license like this.
40:56
(audience laughs) "Take it." Man come back, I'm sitting there, and I'm waiting.
41:02
He come back. Oh, here I go. Let me get it ready.
41:09
"Sir, do you know that your license is suspended?" And here I go. (Ali gasps)
41:14
"Are you serious?" (audience laughs) Same trooper who pulled me over the first time said...
41:21
(audience groaning) "Not this time, Ali. Get your ass out the car."
41:26
(audience laughs) (audience applauds)
41:34
And you getting out the car talking about, "Are you serious?" Get your ass in the back of that car.
41:40
(audience laughs) (lively music) You said you was on the run when they...
41:46
- Well, said I got a parole violation, but they charged me with possession with the intent to deliver. - I had that.
41:52
That's what I went, for that delivery. I tried to get a possession. I told my attorney, "Hey, go in there and tell them I'm a user."
41:58
He said, "Man, five kilos?" I'm like, "Hey, man, I gotta have it." (all laughing)
42:03
I said, "Do it." That man was like, "Man, you gonna get some more time going in there with that bull crap."
42:09
- These lawyers and these judges, and they just all in cahoots. That was the thing I heard a lot of.
42:16
"Man, judge, lawyer, everybody against me." - They go to the country club together.
42:22
- They all work together. - You know what I'm saying? - Golfing and smoking together. Smoking cigarettes. "Hey, how is your son doing on the football team?"
42:27
"Oh, he doing great, your honor." But it's like a bogus case, though, 'cause I'm really here for the violation.
42:33
- You know every case bogus. Every case that come through is bogus. I've never heard anybody say, "Hey, man, they caught me dead to the right,
42:40
you know what I'm saying, I had that thing." What happened, AJM? - Man, they caught me dead to the right.
42:46
(all laughing) Had that thing. (groovy music)
42:52
- So as the captain, this is the number one thing that you will hear back there, that everybody is in cahoots.
42:59
- Most inmates tell me, "Why don't you send me to court?" I don't have anything to do with the court docket. - You know the judge. (both laughing)
43:05
- I have nothing nothing to do with that. - You call the prosecutor. That's your boy, ain't he? - Yeah, put in a word for me.
43:11
Yeah. That's not our role. Our role is to take care of you while you're here and keep you locked up until we get the proper paperwork
43:18
to say you can go. (lively music)
43:24
- Hey, man. Y'all got to be free, man, in your mind. Let me tell you how I made it through this.
43:29
I was free in my mind. I ain't give a shit about this orange, that cell, the count, nothing.
43:37
I was free in here. I made the officers treat me a certain type of way because the officers used to come around
43:43
when I was in prison, shit. They come in, "Chow time!" I hate that shit.
43:48
Hate that shit. I ain't no goddamn animal. Call me no damn chow time. Dude, "Chow time!"
43:54
I said, "Johnson, what meal would this be for you?"
44:00
"Lunch." I say, "That's what I want you to say for me. I want you to say that. I want you to say chow for everybody else, lunch for me."
44:07
(audience laughs) I was on that unit for two years, Johnson always said, "Chow time!
44:16
Lunch, Ali." "Thank you." (audience laughs and applauds)
44:26
People will treat you how you demand to be treated through your character. Man, and I was six years in the penitentiary. Six years.
44:35
And I was young, 19 when I first got there. 19 when I got there. And I was young and jovial.
44:41
And man, and penitentiary got this thing. Any of y'all been to penitentiary? Who been in penitentiary? Been there, okay cool.
44:47
So you know about that yellow line. You know about that yellow line. Everybody talking, "Yellow line! Inside yellow line!"
44:52
You like, "Man, what the fuck is inside the yellow line?" "All inside yellow line! Inside yellow line!"
44:59
So I'm walking, and captain, he in the middle of the captain station in the middle, he hollering out, "Inside yellow line!"
45:04
So me, I'm walking, I don't see nobody outside the yellow line.
45:10
I'm like, why is cap keep hollering and there ain't nobody outside the yellow line?
45:15
You know something? I'ma give the cap somebody to holler at. So I just walked in the middle of hallway, just...
45:22
(audience laughs) "Ali, inside the yellow line!" He run down there.
45:28
"Ali!" Put me on the wall. Put me on the wall. I'm standing there, he's like, "Man, did you hear me say inside the yellow line?" I said, "Yeah cap, I did hear you
45:35
hollering inside the yellow line. And I looked and nobody was on the outside of the yellow line,
45:41
wasn't nobody on the outside of yellow line, so I decided I would give you somebody to be hollering at so you wouldn't be looking crazy as hell
45:48
in this hallway." I said, "See captain, you don't know when somebody trying to help you out." (audience laughs and applauds)
45:58
So he gets mad and put me on the wall, he got me on the wall, which is a mistake.
46:04
You can't put me on the wall and everybody going to eat. I'm on the wall, I'm talking to everybody. "What's up, boy?
46:09
Yeah, boy, I see what you doing. You owe me two soup, didn't know that, you owe me two soup. (audience laughs)

Let me tell you what I did not like about intake. - What's that? - Why you gotta wear? I got on draws.
46:27
This is jail. I got on draws when I came here. Why I gotta put somebody else's draws on? Why can't I keep my own draws?
46:33
- Because we issue draws. - But I don't need your draws. I got the draws on I wanna wear. - No. Gotta go with what we put you in.
46:40

47:19
Yeah see, 'cause I was SSI. I was SSI. You SSI, that mean you got a broom. (audience laughs)
47:25
And when you get a broom, oh shit, a broom is a pass around the whole prison.

'cause it ain't about the physical prison. It's about the mental prison. Let me tell you something.
50:30
Anybody can be in a mental prison. Man, I met this 22-year-old white girl, been arrested seven times for burglary.
50:37
She told me she don't wanna come to jail for burglary no more. I said, "Well, why you stealing?
50:43
You gotta take care of yourself or something?" She said, "No, Xanax. Xanax make me steal." (audience laughs)
50:49
I say, "Xanax make you steal?" I say, "Who the hell prescribes you something
50:54
that's gonna make you steal?" She say, "Oh, no. I ain't got no prescription for it." (audience laughs)
50:59
I said, "Well, if you wanna stay out of jail, shit, it's pretty simple to me. I ain't even known you that long. I can figure this out.
51:06
Why don't you just stop taking Xanax?" Said, "Why?" I said, "So you'll stop stealing, and then you won't come here."
51:12
She's like, "Oh." (audience laughs and applauds)
51:23
She said she had never thought of it like that. I said, "Shit, I don't think you ever thought of this shit, period." (audience laughs)
51:30
- I get out of here tomorrow. - You get out tomorrow? - Yes. - So what you doing when you get out? - Shoot, going back to my family and go back to rodeoing.
51:38
I rodeo, I ride bulls for a living. - That's honorable. - I'm actually a world champion bull rider. I just got caught up in the middle of drugs and fighting,
51:46
and bounced up in here for a little while. - Drugs and fighting. - Yes, sir. - A lady explained to me
51:51
that I was a bigger drug addict than she was. And I said, "How so?"
51:56
She said, "The difference is this. You use drugs for recreation.
52:04
You can stop recreating whenever you want to. I was using drugs for my livelihood. How you stop that?"
52:11
Now, I'm addicted to that bread. I'm addicted to that lifestyle. I'm addicted to being able to go out
52:16
and buy all my friends dinner, and saying, "Man, y'all order what y'all wanna order. Hey, man. You need something?"
52:22
I'm addicted to that. - Right. - Is the addiction gone? - Nope. - No.
52:28
It's making the decision to say, "Man, you know something? I can take that risk and end up back in jail,
52:36
or I can put that same energy into doing something different." - Yes, sir.
52:41
(lively music)
52:48
- You know, the longer you stay in this place, you gonna always have one of them days
52:54
that you just not gonna be feeling it. You gonna be wanting to get out of here. You don't come in my cell! Don't wreck my cell!
52:59
You understand what I'm saying? Mine came at the five-year mark. Man, I woke up one day. I was tired of that shit.
53:06
I woke up, and I'm like, "Nah, I ain't feeling this shit today." (audience laughs)
53:12
Them people popped my door, man. I got up... closed the door, and I pushed the button.
53:18
I said, "Hey... Don't pop my door, man. Not today," slammed it.
53:24
Popped the door again. "I just told you, 'Don't pop my door,' man."
53:30
Boom, slammed my door. (Ali imitates buzzing) Boom, popped the door again. I said, "All right. I got something for y'all then."
53:36
I, boom, kicked the door closed and knocked them off the rails. Now it's jammed.
53:41
So they send a negotiator. I said, "What's up?" "If you don't come out the cell, you know we gonna have to extract you."
53:47
I said, "Well, get your goddamn extraction on then, homeboy." The man said, "Williams, are you okay?"
53:56
See, I didn't tell y'all that my celly, Williams, was still in the cell. (audience laughs)
54:02
And Williams just woke up. Williams was an old man. He woke up, "Man, what the hell is wrong with this boy?" (audience laughs)
54:08
And William said, "Man, I'm good." I said, "Shut up, William! Shut up! I'm holding him hostage,"
54:14
And Williams was like, "I ain't no damn hostage." And this when you know that it's serious. This is when you know they're serious, when they say, "Raid up!"
54:21
You like, "Ooh, they racking people up. Shit. (audience laughs) They racking them up. That mean they coming in here.
54:26
They coming in here. Shit." And you wanna give up. You wanna give up 'cause you know they about to get ready,
54:32

54:38
"You already know! You already know!" And then you see them guards getting ready. Hup! Two! Shield! Hup!
54:44

55:37
The shield's electric. Shield's electric. As soon as they hit you, you on the shield. (audience laughs)
55:44
You slid down the whole shield. Your ass done got boiled and fried at the same time,
55:50
'cause you're standing in the water, and you greasy, and them people packaged your ass up
55:56

56:16
And the people like, "You ain't did shit. Hup!" (audience laughing and applauding)
56:29
So you gotta be free. That's the freedom that you wanted. I don't give a shit how I grew up, 'cause I'm grown now.
56:34
I can change. I can change. That's what we forget. We always talking about how we grew up.

Do you run your house like your mama ran her house? No, you leave all your goddamn lights on. 'Cause your mama told you not to leave the lights on,
56:45
now this your house. You leave them lights on 'cause you want to. You don't make up the bed. You eat what you wanna eat. Now, you have to take that same mentality
56:52

56:57
You gotta get out of them mental jails, and it's a responsibility for each and every one of us.
