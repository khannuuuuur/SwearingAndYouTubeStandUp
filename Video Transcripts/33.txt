What's up, New Orleans?
0:07
This is Comedy Central Stand Up Presents.
0:11
Please welcome Chris Redd.
0:14
(audience cheers and applauds)
0:19
- New Orleans, what up?
0:22
(audience cheers and applauds)
0:27
Chris Redd.
0:29
Hey.
0:30
(audience laughs)
0:32
Man, I'm from Chicago, man.
0:33
I've been in LA about a year, man. It's cool.
0:35
There's some differences I noticed, you know,
0:38
like the weather is (beep) amazing.
0:43
In Chicago, it's crazy. It was 20 degrees
0:45
and Chicago got real cold. That means I'm cold bougie.
0:47
And I experienced my first LA winter
0:50
and that (beep) was (beep) adorable.
0:53
It's like 70 degrees, mother(beep) are wearing scarves!
0:56
(audience laughs)
0:57
Double wrapped.
0:59
Walking around like they own a castle.
1:01
Take that (beep) off your neck.
1:03
(audience laughs)
1:05
The sun is out. You know your neck is sweaty.
1:08
Now you out here with a wet neck endangering the world.
1:12
People with wet necks make bad decisions.
1:14
Hitler had a wet neck the whole time.
1:16
(audience laughs)
1:20
They left that out the history books.
1:24
But I love it now, man. I was in Atlanta.
1:26
(audience cheers)
1:27
I love Atlanta. I love the A. Yeah, y'all get crazy.
1:30
Y'all strippers don't stop twerking. That's crazy.
1:33
(audience laughs)
1:34
I love Atlanta man.
1:35
I was in that airport for five hours
1:37
'cause they got two inches of snow
1:39
and shut the whole city down.
1:41
That (beep) was amazing to me, man.
1:43
People left their cars on the highway.
1:46
They saw two inches of snow and said, "(beep) this"
1:49
and got out the car.
1:50
"We're walking, come on kids."
1:52
That is not how you deal with snow.
1:56
And they don't have snow all the time,
1:57
so they're not walking confidently in snow,
1:59
so it's a whole highway full of cartoon characters.
2:01
Oh ho ho!
2:03
(audience laughs)
2:04
ThatÂ£ is stupid.
2:08
But I was in the airport acting a fool, man.
2:10
I was smacking people.
2:12
Y'all don't know what cold is. Like, "Why you smack me?"
2:14
That's what Chicago wind feels like, bitch.
2:17
(audience laughs)
2:19
Turn up.
2:21
I like to say turn up after things I do wrong.
2:23
That's great.
2:26
I was, I met this lady though, man.
2:29
I was waiting there about five hours, you know?
2:31
And I was, I walked up to her and I was like,
2:33
"Hey Tanya. Yeah, we've been waiting like four hours, man.
2:37
You got any kind of updates?
2:38
Anything you could possibly tell us at all
2:40
when we'll get outta here?"
2:41
Yo, she doesn't answer me at all.
2:43
She jumps right on the intercom,
2:48
(audience laughs)
2:51
(Chris sighs)
2:52
(audience laughs)
2:54
"Thank you for choosing Delta airlines.
2:58
This is is Tanya.
3:00
Now I know some of y'all got questions.
3:04
(audience laughs)
3:12
I got questions too.
3:14
(audience laughs and cheers)
3:22
But right now, we ain't boarding the plane
3:24
because we can't find the captain.
3:28
(audience laughs)
3:31
I don't know.
3:32
I don't see him, so I don't know.
3:37
So if you got any other questions,
3:39
I'm gonna need you to be like Superman lifting a Mustang
3:42
and hold your horses. Thank you.
3:45
(audience applauds)
3:50
I don't know why everybody's so mad about these two inches
3:52
shutting the whole city down
3:53
because I shut down every time I see two inches.
3:56
You hear me, bitch?"
3:57
(audience cheers)
3:59
And we are Facebook friends
4:00
'cause that was some gangster (beep) to say at your job!
4:04
She was at work!
4:06
Her manager, Todd, came out and was like,
4:08
"Uh, excuse me, Tanya. Uh,
4:10
yeah, Tanya, you can't say that on the intercom."
4:13
And Tanya turned with no hesitation and was like,
4:15
"Todd, I've been working 16 hours every day
4:19
for seven days straight. And I ain't got no goddamn bonus.
4:23
I say whatever the (beep) I want.
4:29
(audience applauds and cheers)
4:38
And Todd was like, "I'm gonna go on break.
4:40
Okay. I'm like, we're on break."
4:43
I keep in touch with her though, man.
4:44
I Skype her all the time.
4:47
I Skyped her three weeks ago just to check up on her.
4:49
It was her day off.
4:51
I was like, "Yo Tanya, what's up? How you doing?"
4:54
She was like, (inhales and exhales) "I'm good.
4:58
I mean, these kids driving me crazy,
4:59
but they mine, so they still here."
5:02
(audience laughs)
5:05
Which I feel like that's the slogan for parenting.
5:08
(audience laughs)
5:10
Like I never had kids, but like,
5:11
"Parenting: they're still yours, so they're still here."
5:14
(audience laughs)
5:16
So we talked for a while and then I was like,
5:18
"Yo, go get the kids. I wanna say something to 'em
5:20
before I get off the phone."
5:22
So she runs off, right? She was gone for two minutes.
5:24
She comes back and she was like,
5:26
"Chris, I gotta go. I'm so sorry.
5:28
I left my kids at the mall."
5:29
What?
5:30
(audience laughs)
5:33
Tanya was so high. she left her kids at the mall!
5:37
She was driving home like, "They are so quiet.
5:39
I'm so proud of them."
5:40
They're not there, bitch. Turn around.
5:42
(audience laughs)
5:46
You became a bad mother so fast.
5:50
Love this, man. We're in some crazy times right now, man.
5:53
It's good to see some couples out here.
5:54
You in love, make some noise real quick. You in love?
5:57
(audience cheers)
5:59
Look at this interracial couple.
6:01
Martin Luther king would be proud of y'all (beep).
6:04
How long y'all been together?
6:06
Three months?
6:08
Oh, so that's not (beep) at all.
6:10
(audience laughs and applauds)
6:13
Y'all mother(beep) playing pretend right now, son.
6:17
I like the first year. The first year is the most fun.
6:20
Oh, so fun. Right? It's the most fun.
6:22
It's not the most meaningful, but it's the most fun
6:25
'cause both of y'all don't know how crazy you are yet.
6:28
Y'all have no idea
6:31
how crazy you are the first year.
6:32
You just play pretend, you do cute (beep).
6:34
Everything's cute, you do cute stuff.
6:36
Like hold each other all night. That's some fake-ass (beep).
6:40
No real couple does that garbage.
6:42
And if you're with somebody past a year
6:44
and they're still holding you all night,
6:45
you are dating a serial killer
6:47
(audience laughs)
6:50
and they will wear your skin to the bank,
6:53
just to the bank, wearing your skin.
6:56
That's crazy.
6:57
"I wake up when you wake up,"
6:58
how is that not insane?
7:01
"Have you been to sleep?"
7:02
"No, girl, you sleep for the both of us."
7:05
That's crazy!
7:07
(audience laughs)
7:09
You can't get all the way to sleep
7:10
holding another person all night.
7:11
It's impossible.
7:13
She moves, you wake up. You move, she wakes up.
7:15
She farts, you act like she ain't do it
7:17
'cause you trying to be cute.
7:20
(blows raspberry) "Was that me?"
7:21
"No, girl, that was Jesus."
7:23
(audience laughs)
7:30
The sex is amazing. You can do new sex moves
7:33
because she hasn't learned your (beep) pattern yet.
7:37
Every spouse knows how you have sex, right?
7:39
Monday through Sunday.
7:40
That's how weeks work, right? Yeah.
7:42
(audience laughs)
7:44
But that first year, everything's in your repertoire.
7:47
You know what I'm saying?
7:47
That's great.
7:49
And after sex, you'll both sit there, lay there,
7:50
holding each other all night
7:52
in that wet spot, chilling like you both wanna be there.
7:55
(audience laughs)
7:57
You know that wet spot!
8:00
Vagina juice, back sweat, little bit of hope.
8:02
It's all that, right there.
8:06
And the people that are reacting,
8:07
you're having great sex. You continue to have great sex.
8:11
And the people that aren't reacting, you just found out
8:13
you've been having terrible sex your whole life.
8:16
(audience laughs)
8:17
And that's not my fault.
8:20
'Cause good sex creates a wet spot.
8:23
And if you're a strategic man, you have sex on her side,
8:26
so you sleep dry.
8:28
(audience cheers and applauds)
8:35
And if you're a real woman, you make him switch
8:37
'cause you run this.
8:39
(audience laughs and applauds)
8:42
And if y'all a power couple, you have sex on the couch
8:44
and make your friends deal with that juice.
8:47
(audience cheers)
8:50
Moving to LA, some things that were very weird to me
8:53
were the crack heads. Crack heads were very weird.
8:56
Chicago, we have top of the line crack heads.
9:00
Top of the line!
9:01
Can't get better than them.
9:03
I got to Hollywood, very different crack head.
9:06
You know?
9:07
I was walking on Hollywood Boulevard,
9:08
don't know if anybody's been here,
9:10
but Hollywood Boulevard's where all the stars were,
9:12
all the stars in the ground.
9:13
People, everybody who visits Hollywood goes there.
9:16
Somebody was walking, right?
9:17
Regular guy had a camera on his chest,
9:18
so I assumed he was a tourist or a pervert
9:20
who was not shy about letting people know.
9:25
He put his whole human face
9:26
on Marilyn Monroe's star to take a selfie.
9:28
I'm like, "Yo, you got hepatitis A through Z now, fam.
9:32
Get your face off that damn street. Where is your father?"
9:35
(audience laughs)
9:38
So as I'm yelling at this stranger,
9:39
this crack head walks up to me, behind me. Right?
9:41
He was like, "Hey brother!
9:43
(audience laughs)
9:45
Brother, come here."
9:47
I don't know why he was rubbing himself like this.
9:50
I didn't ask him 'cause I didn't wanna know the answer.
9:54
If I walked up to you and I said,
9:55
"Hey brother, how you doing?" and I was rubbing myself
9:57
would you ask me why?
9:58
No, (beep) you wouldn't.
10:03
But I was, so I was looking at his eyes
10:04
and I was trying not to look down.
10:05
I was like, "Hey, uh,
10:07
(audience laughs)
10:10
what's up man?"
10:12
He was like, "Come here!"
10:13
He was already this close.
10:14
I was like, "(beep), you in my face."
10:17
I took one finger and I was like,
10:19
"There's no more here for me to come, mother(beep).
10:20
Back up."
10:23
He's like, "Oh, I'm sorry.
10:25
I don't know space.
10:26
Hey, Hey, Hey.
10:30
Pick a card,
10:32
(audience laughs)
10:34
any card."
10:36
He didn't have a card in his goddamn hands, people.
10:39
Not one (beep) card.
10:40
I looked down at his hand like,
10:41
"Where the (beep) are the cards, man?"
10:43
He looked down at his hand like he was surprised with me.
10:46
"Oh, ho, ho, ho, ho!
10:47
(audience laughs and applauds)
10:56
Well, then I guess, ta-da."
10:57
You can't, "Well, then I guess-"
10:59
you can't stumble upon magic.
11:02
You're unprepared, you son of a bitch.
11:05
Then he walked away, bumping into people.
11:07
"Excuse me. Ta-da."
11:08
You can't hand out ta-das.
11:10
The hell are you doing?
11:12
I called my friend, I was so mad.
11:14
I was so mad at this crack head, I called my friend like,
11:16
"Yo, dog, I'm so (beep) pissed off."
11:18
He was like, "What happened?"
11:19
"I was talking to this crack head."
11:20
My friend was like, "Your fault."
11:21
(audience laughs)
11:25
"Yeah, you right," and I hung up the phone.
11:27
(audience laughs)
11:30
'Cause I accept when I'm wrong.
11:33
I saw him again, though.
11:35
Saw him again, same street.
11:37
It's different people there.
11:40
This lady, her name was Rebecca, she was having a birthday.
11:43
"It's my birthday,"
11:46
very drunk, wouldn't shut the (beep) up.
11:50
And her friend was helping her walk like,
11:51
"Yes, Rebecca, it's your birthday.
11:53
Use your legs, bitch. Damn."
11:55
(audience laughs)
11:57
It's a solid friendship.
12:00
And as they're walking down the street,
12:03
this magical crack head jumped out the bushes.
12:07
Now listen, I don't know how long this man
12:08
been sitting in these bushes,
12:11
but his timing was impeccable.
12:14
Amazing. I'll give you a quick replay,
12:16
so you saw how I saw it.
12:18
"It's my birthday." "Yes, Rebecca, it's your birthday.
12:20
Use your legs, bitch. Damn."
12:22
Crack head on cue,
12:24
"Don't nobody give a damn about your birthday!"
12:28
(audience laughs and applauds)
12:33
Then he walked back into bushes. What?
12:36
(audience laughs and applauds)
12:39
Yo, I've never seen a grown man walk back in some bushes
12:42
like he had other (beep) to attend to.
12:46
"Y'all keep it down out here.
12:47
I'm in here rubbing my nipples and doing experiments."
12:51
What?
12:54
Yo, I had to know. I had to know what he was about.
12:56
I had to ask him some questions.
12:58
I had to give him some money, if he needed it,
12:59
but I wasn't bringing my black ass in those bushes.
13:03
That's how he got there, little crack head Narnia.
13:07
"You can never leave
13:10
unless it's a white lady's birthday."
13:18
So I wasn't walking in those bushes,
13:20
but I walked outside of the bushes.
13:22
I said the one thing I could think of to get him to pop out
13:24
so I could ask him some questions
13:25
and help him out if he needed it, right?
13:27
So I walked outside the bushes.
13:28
I was like,
13:32
"Yo, it's my birthday too!"
13:34
(audience laughs)
13:35
I thought that was his thing.
13:36
He's like, "Not again."
13:37
You know what I mean?
13:42
But he didn't. He didn't pop out at all.
13:45
All I heard from the bushes was, "No, it ain't."
13:47
Like how the (beep) you know that, bro? Whoa!
13:50
(audience laughs)
13:52
Whoa!
13:54
Yo, and I said, under my breath, I was like,
13:56
"Man, this (beep) is magic."
14:00
And then as soon as I said that, he was like, "Ta-da."
14:04
(audience cheers)
14:09
My cousin came out for real, though.
14:11
I have a cousin that came out for real.
14:13
He wanted to do it down south,
14:14
in front of all of my family members.
14:16
We're from Mississippi.
14:18
So Thanksgiving, in front of 40 of my family members
14:21
and that's like a unique place to come out.
14:26
(audience laughs)
14:28
And he hit me up 'cause he wanted some support, you know?
14:30
He texted me first. He was like,
14:32
"Yo, yo, yo, Chris. Yo, Chris, yo. Yo, dog, uh,
14:36
I got something to tell the family ellipses."
14:39
And I was like, "Cool, cool, cool.
14:41
Why'd you spell out 'ellipses'? That is not how that works.
14:45
Dot, dot, dot. That's how that works, fam."
14:48
(audience laughs)
14:54
Then after that text, I was like, "You gay?"
14:57
(audience laughs)
15:00
And then he sent me a text like, "What?!
15:04
How'd you know?"
15:06
And then I sent him another text, like,
15:08
"Yo, I've been known.
15:09
I thought she was trapped in the closet."
15:11
And then I sent him a gif of R. Kelly
15:12
just doing this (beep).
15:14
(audience applauds and laughs)
15:22
And he was like, "That's a dope gif. Dope.
15:25
It's a dope gif."
15:26
But he's like, "For real, no, how'd you know?"
15:28
And I think, well, no one really knows, right?
15:30
No one really knows until somebody tells you
15:32
or you walk into a room and you're like 90% sure, you know?
15:38
But when I had an idea that he might be a little different,
15:42
I was dating this girl.
15:43
I was very young at the time, so I was very ignorant,
15:45
and I got this naked picture.
15:46
It was my first naked picture I ever got, right?
15:49
And this girl was posed up in the bedroom
15:51
in front of her mirror so you could see the bedroom
15:53
in the background. And it was a weird,
15:55
it was a weird pose
15:58
because there was no wall right here.
16:01
So this was just a decision, my (beep).
16:05
She was like, "No!"
16:08
And then she was leaning too much,
16:10
so one titty was alone. It looked lonely.
16:13
The loneliest titty you ever did see.
16:16
And I was like, "Oh, I hope she reunites those titties!"
16:18
(audience laughs)
16:22
So I passed it to all my friends
16:24
because I was an ignorant kid at the time,
16:25
and everybody was like, "Oh, those titties are lonely!"
16:30
And then it got to my cousin
16:32
and my cousin takes one look at the picture and he's like,
16:38
"She need to clean up her room. That is not ladylike."
16:41
(audience laughs)
16:44
You looking at the wrong thing, brother.
16:46
Look at the titties. He's like,
16:48
"(beep) those titties, look at that decor."
16:52
And I snatched this picture back.
16:54
and I was like, "Yeah, you different."
16:56
(audience laughs)
16:58
Real different.
17:00
But of course I had his back, you know?
17:01
Of course, I had his back, so it comes to Thanksgiving.
17:04
We all about to dig into the food, right?
17:06
And just as we about to dig in,
17:07
my cousin kicks down the door,
17:10
"Everybody stop eating.
17:13
I've got something to say.
17:17
For as long as I can ever remember,
17:20
I've been gay.
17:22
(audience laughs)
17:25
So eat on that."
17:28
(audience applauds and cheers)
17:37
That response is beautiful
17:38
because that was not the response of that day.
17:42
Everybody froze, it was silence,
17:44
but I was cracking up 'cause I was like,
17:45
"Yo, that choreography was the (beep), son!
17:50
What kinda gay Temptation are you?" (beep)
17:53
(audience cheers and applauds)
17:58
"Eat on that."
17:59
Now, what?
18:01
Eat on that?
18:02
That's a hashtag. I hashtagged that (beep) for a year.
18:05
Eat on that? That was hilarious.
18:09
Also, he kicked the door down
18:11
and it was already open.
18:14
Grandma gonna kick your ass for that.
18:17
It was beautiful, it was a beautiful moment for me.
18:20
But everybody, no one said anything for about 10 seconds.
18:24
And I don't know if you've seen anybody come out before,
18:27
but 10 seconds is a very long time to hear silence.
18:31
So he looked at me, he was like, "Chris."
18:35
And so I looked back at him. I was like,
18:37
"I got you."
18:40
I stood up real fast
18:42
and I ain't, I ain't know what I was gonna say.
18:46
I ain't never come out before,
18:47
I ain't never come out with association.
18:49
I ain't did this before,
18:51
but I was confident with my stand-up
18:55
and I was like, "Uh,
19:00
ta-da!
19:02
(audience applauds and cheers)
19:16
He's gay!"
19:21
And my dad stood up, anger on his face.
19:24
And my brother, straight man. Me, I'm straight.
19:26
My sister's straight, so we've never had this issue,
19:29
so we never really talked about it.
19:30
He had a lot of anger on his face.
19:31
I was like, "Oh my God, what is gonna happen?
19:33
He looks mad. Is my dad a bigot?
19:35
Am I gonna find out right now?
19:37
This is crazy.
19:38
Over cornbread? No."
19:40
(audience laughs)
19:46
You ever had something real bad happen
19:47
over your favorite food and it like taints it forever?
19:51
And then every time you eat it, you are like,
19:52
"Huh, racism."
19:54
(audience laughs)
19:57
He was looking mad, you know?
20:00
I was like, "Oh no, what the hell's gonna happen?"
20:02
He was like, "Enough of this (beep)! Jimmy,
20:09

20:12
(audience applauds and cheers)
