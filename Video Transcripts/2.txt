0:01
That's a weird one.
0:02
She spent the night.
0:03
A one night stand spending the night is like,
0:06
I mean, that's like if you ordered in food
0:07
and the delivery guy stayed while you ate it.
0:09
(audience laughing)
0:10
(upbeat music)
0:14
I ran into my biological father recently.
0:16
I told my friend, he was like,
0:17
"Is your biological father a good person?"
0:19
And I was like, "If he were, I probably would not
0:21
refer to him as my biological father."
0:22
(audience laughing)
0:26
Most people say dad.
0:27
(audience laughing)
0:32
I look exactly like him. I show my friend a picture.
0:33
He was like, "Oh my God.
0:34
It's like you guys were separated at birth."
0:36
(audience laughing)
0:37
We were.
0:38
(audience laughing)
0:42
I liked the cool dad when I was a kid.
0:44
My friend's dad would smoke weed with us, and I was like,
0:46
"This guy is cool." You know?
0:47
Now that I'm older, it turns out he is not cool.
0:49
(audience laughing)
0:50
Turns out he's a grown man that did drugs with children, so.
0:52
(audience laughing)
0:54
Quite the opposite.
0:55
(audience laughing)
0:58
First time I met my biological father,
0:59
he took me out to lunch, and the place he took me
1:01
turned out to be a family style restaurant,
1:03
which kind of ironic.
1:06
They should make broken family style restaurants.
1:08
(audience laughing)
1:09
You just walk in, like, "Where's the waiter?"
1:11
(audience laughing)
1:13
I think he abandoned us. I don't know, but...
1:15
(audience laughing)
1:18
They forget to come out and sing Happy Birthday.
1:19
They're like, "We forgot, but-"
1:21
(audience laughing)
1:22
"We'll make it up to you next year."
1:25
Another guy comes out, he's like,
1:26
"I don't actually work here. I'm just banging the owner.
1:29
I'll be your step waiter."
1:30
(audience laughing)
1:33
Is that one too real for the crowd? Sorry.
1:34
(audience laughing)
1:35
It's hard not to drink, man. It's very hard.
1:38
I work in a place where there's a bar every night.
1:40
I've been trying to be good. It's very difficult.
1:42
I read this article that said,
1:43
"Try to replace drinking with another activity,
1:46
like tennis with a friend."
1:47
I was like, "Yeah, that's a very helpful example.
1:49
That's always the crossroads I find myself at at 4:57 a.m."
1:55
I can't tell you how often I'm coming out
1:56
of a blackout like,
1:57
"Fuck, I should have done doubles instead."
1:58
(audience laughing)
2:00
I brought my Wilson racket and everything.
2:04
You're telling me to replace an addiction with cardio.
2:06
That's very helpful.
2:07
(audience laughing)
2:08
I'm gonna start walking in the halfway houses
2:10
full of crack heads, like, "Have you guys done Zumba?"
2:12
It's- (audience laughing)
2:14
So much better than crack.
2:16
(audience laughing)
2:17
They're like, "Thanks, we didn't know.
2:18
"That was helpful."
2:20
Of course you want to get fucked up.
2:23
Have you have you tried living?
2:25
(audience laughing)
2:28
I'm happy and I want to get fucked up.
2:30
Have you watched the news? It makes you want to drink.
2:33
Another mass shooting after another mass shooting.
2:35
It's always the same thing too.
2:36
It's always some guy who's like,
2:37
"I heard voices in my head."
2:40
We all do.
2:41
(audience laughing)
2:42
Everyone hears voices in their head.
2:44
Good people just don't listen to them.
2:46
- If I listened to all the voices in my head,
2:48
I would be a sometimes gay street fighter, so.
2:50
(audience laughing)
2:54
I was in a relationship two and a half years.
2:56
I never cheated once, not once.
2:58
I'm on the road all the the time.
2:59
People are like, "What's your secret?
3:01
How do you stay faithful on the road?"
3:03
This is my secret. I'll tell you.
3:04
Two and a half years never cheated once.
3:06
My secret, not one woman tried to (beep) me.
3:10
(audience laughing)
3:13
I mean, thank you. Thank you.
3:16
(audience laughing)
3:19
Am I a hero? Yes I am.
3:20
(audience laughing)
3:22
I'd be alone on a plane, beautiful women walking towards me.
3:24
I'd be like, "This chick better not sit next to me."
3:27
She'd sit next to me. We wouldn't speed the entire flight.
3:29
I'd be like, "That was a close call."
3:31
I mean- (audience laughing)
3:34
I'm an amazing person.
3:35
(audience laughing)
3:37
Then your friends pressure you to get on these dating apps.
3:40
They're very intimidating.
3:42
Sometimes the pictures don't even match the occupation.
3:45
Just like a gorgeous woman bent over
3:46
with a finger in her mouth and you're like,
3:48
Saint Jude's Children's Hospital?
3:50
(audience laughing)
3:53
If you say so, I'm just worried about the children
3:55
at this point, you know?
3:57
One of my friends was like,
3:58
"I got this dating site for you."
4:00
Comes over, it's a prison dating site.
4:03
Incarcerated women was his suggestion.
4:06
And we laughed for like five minutes,
4:07
but then like minutes six, we're like,
4:08
"There's some attractive women here."
4:09
(audience laughing)
4:12
But then it shows you the crimes they commit,
4:13
and you're like, double homicide's probably
4:14
a bad idea, you know?
4:15
(audience laughing)
4:16
But they have actual profiles.
4:18
One of 'em actually said, "I love the outdoors."
4:19
You're like, "Yeah, I mean obviously."
4:21
(audience laughing)
4:25
I mean, turns out you like money laundering
4:27
a bit more unfortunately, but-
4:29
(audience laughing)
4:30
But how much true crime is there gonna be?
4:32
Are you guys watching this like me?
4:33
It's so addictive. Yeah.
4:35
Give it up for all these murderers
4:36
for all this great content.
4:37
You keep killing. We'll keep watching.
4:40
That's what I say.
4:41
(audience laughing)
4:43
I don't wanna point fingers here,
4:45
but you women are getting murdered at an alarming rate.
4:47
I don't know if you're paying attention.
4:50
I would recommend never going home with us, ever.
4:52
(audience laughing)
4:54
If a woman goes home with you,
4:55
she really trusts you, or she's taking a chance, you know?
4:58
So whenever I open the door, I always turn to her and I say,
5:00
"Hey, thanks for rolling the dice."
5:02
You know? (audience laughing)
5:05
I appreciate it.
5:07
That's all I watch is murder and stand up.
5:11
I've been doing this for a while.
5:12
I see comics sometimes on Netflix.
5:14
I'm like, "This guy fucking stinks."
5:16
I wonder if murderers watch true crime,
5:18
like, "This is pretty disappointing honestly."
5:20
(audience laughing)
5:22
Three murders in five years?
5:25
I should be the one on television.
5:26
(audience laughing)
5:28
Delta took away 20,000 of my hard earned
5:30
road comedian airline miles.
5:32
This happened six years ago, but I'm not over it.
5:34
And- (audience laughing)
5:36
I called to complain and this woman picks up the phone.
5:38
She just goes, "Oh, we don't do this anymore."
5:40
I was like, "You don't do what?"
5:41
She was like, "We don't do complaints anymore."
5:43
(audience laughing)
5:47
Pardon me?
5:50
She's like, "Yeah, you can email our complaint division
5:51
but it takes like six months."
5:52
And I was like, "That's ridiculous."
5:53
Then she said, "Also, your mother's a (beep)."
5:56
(audience laughing)
5:58
I'm paraphrasing, but that's how her words
6:00
made me feel, you know?
6:01
I can say whatever I want as long as that's how I feel.
6:03
That's what my therapist Allen says.
6:06
(audience laughing)
6:08
So I get transferred to my next rep. She's even worse.
6:10
She said, "Well, your miles are from 2010.
6:13
We didn't start keeping track until 2011, so sorry."
6:18
Yeah, she said, "Sorry."
6:21
with an A-Y.
6:23
It's the least sincere apology of all.
6:25
You would never go to a funeral, "Sorry."
6:27
(audience laughing)
6:31
And if you do, that's the murderer right there.
6:33
(audience laughing)
6:35
"Sorry for your loss."
6:37
(audience laughing)
6:40
Are you?
6:43
So I said, "This isn't fair."
6:44
She said, "Well, I don't know what to tell you."
6:47
Said, "I feel like you're being kind of condescending."
6:48
She said, "Oh, am I?"
6:51
"Yeah, you're talking down to me."
6:52
She said, "Oh, well."
6:55
I'm not proud of what I said next. It was a little subtle.
6:57
I said, "I hope that you die in a fire."
6:59
(audience laughing)
7:02
True story. She hung up on me.
7:05
Look, I overstepped a little.
7:06
Rude customer service. Hour plus hold the time.
7:08
Fiery death may be a little extreme.
7:10
(audience laughing)
7:11
I should have gone with moderate form of cancer
7:13
for my insult, you know?
7:16
You guys can pull back here, but I'm gonna power through,
7:17
'cause I believe in myself.
7:18
I'm talking treatable, stage 1 cancer.
7:22
And then she shows up at the hospital
7:23
and they're like, "There's nothing we can do.
7:25
Your insurance ran out in 2010, so-"
7:26
(audience laughing)
7:28
"Sorry."
7:30
(audience applauding)
7:31
- I've been having bad allergies and yeah, it's bad.
7:35
I go into the drug store to get Claritin-D,
7:36
and they make you sign a form to prove
7:39
you're not gonna make meth.
7:41
Which I feel like if you're
7:42
in the drug distribution business,
7:44
a waiver is not really deterrent, you know?
7:46
If there's some meth kingpin going down they're like,
7:48
"Not only did he sell methamphetamine,
7:50
he lied to Monique at Walgreens."
7:52
(audience laughing)
7:54
"He's a monster."
7:55
(audience laughing)
7:56
That's a perk by the way, you don't really, you know,
7:58
you don't hear about meth that you don't get allergies.
8:01
(audience laughing)
8:02
Right? That's kind of nice.
8:04
You're walking around about the pollen count.
8:06
Some dude calls out of a dumpster,
8:07
he's like, "I didn't even notice."
8:08
(audience laughing)
8:10
"Too busy trying to find my kids."
8:13
I was,
8:15
been the road a lot lately.
8:16
I was in a Wilmington, North Carolina,
8:18
and I was doing a gig.
8:20
And I was a little, little buzzed, you know, a little drunk.
8:24
And I'm in the elevator and I'm talking
8:26
to this couple in the elevator,
8:28
and I thought they were being nice,
8:29
but they were just messing with me.
8:30
Like at,
8:31
at one point the woman just said,
8:32
"So how was your night?"
8:34
And I said, "It was pretty good. I did two shows."
8:35
She's like, "Oh, you're a comedian?"
8:37
Said, "Yeah." She's like, "Tell us a joke then."
8:39
Then said, "I'd rather not.
8:40
This has never gone well off stage ever in my life."
8:43
She's like, "Just tell us a joke."
8:45
And I'm like, "I'd really rather not."
8:46
Her husband leans and he goes,
8:46
"Tell her a (beep) joke."
8:48
It's like, what are you gonna bully me
8:49
into entertaining you in the elevator?
8:52
No, I'm not gonna tell you a joke,
8:53
and he just gets in my face.
8:54
He goes, "Really?"
8:55
And they just walk out like they one upped me,
8:56
and I feel like an idiot.
8:58
I'm like, why didn't you just tell 'em a joke?
9:00
You could have whipped something up.
9:02
You know a lot of jokes.
9:03
So I'm like, "Oh, hold on a second."
9:04
They turn around and he's like, "What?"
9:05
I said, "I'll tell you a joke."
9:07
He's like, "Oh yeah, you're gonna tell us a joke?"
9:08
Said, "Yeah, here's a joke.
9:09
Two hick dip ships walk into an elevator, right?"
9:12
And I just let the doors slowly shut, right?
9:14
(audience laughing) (audience cheering)
