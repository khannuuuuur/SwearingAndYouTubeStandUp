0:39
I did not know, that's crazy.
0:43
He was like, "Yeah I've been looking for Rice Krispy Treats

Y'all laughing y'all ain't got no motherfucking compass.
2:33
Don't nobody got no compass.
2:36

2:38
Last show somebody was like, "I got one in my phone."
2:39
Bitch, the world is ending.
2:40
You're phone don't work.
2:42
(audience laughing)
2:43
You are not ready for the apocalypse.
2:44
I know y'all ain't ready
2:46
'cause last time the shit went down
2:47
y'all went and bought toilet paper.
2:48
Y'all ain't ready.
2:49
(audience laughing)
2:50
Cause if they said run north right now
2:52

2:55
I got a compass in my back pocket. I'm running north.
2:57
And don't try and follow me 'cause imma zigzag.
2:59
Imma zig zag.
3:00
Y'all ain't catching me.
3:03
Y'all ain't catching me.
3:05
For real, I started getting my stuff together.
3:07
I got me some numb chucks.
3:10
I dunno how to use them but they look dangerous.
3:12
If you run up on me like, "Back up."
3:15
You better back up.
3:19
'Cause if the shit goes down
3:21
my friend's not about to occupy my one bedroom apartment.
3:24
Like, fuck y'all.
3:26
Y'all not about to occupy my balcony.
3:27
The fuck?
3:29
I can see it now.
3:30
They all down on ground, "Brandi, help us."
3:33
I'm up there with my Captain Crunch,
3:35
"You should have prepared."
3:37
(audience laughing)
3:38
With my numb chucks.
3:39
Nah, I'm saving myself.
3:44
Dating in your thirties is different.
3:47
It's different from when you were younger.
3:48
When you were younger
3:49
people could just like whisper sweet nothing's in your ear.
3:53
They just be like,
3:54
(whispering noises)
3:56
You be like, "Hell yeah."
4:00
Fuck yeah, I'm on what you on.
4:05
When you get in your thirties it's different.
4:07
You gotta whisper real stuff to me like,
4:09
"I'm in therapy."
4:11
(audience laughing)
4:13
I be like, "Oh yeah?"
4:19
For real.
4:21
"I want two kids, I wanna send 'em to private school."
4:23
I'm like, "Damn. Making me moist, Daddy."
4:29
(audience laughing)
4:32
I voted in the city elections.
4:33
What? What? What?
4:38
And not just like I voted, like, I got a sticker I voted.
4:40
'Cause y'all motherfuckers
4:42
be love posting them stickers like, "I voted."
4:44
You Christmas treed that voting, Paul,
4:46
you don't even know who you voted for.
4:48
But no like I really voted
4:50
like he knows the issues that he was voting on.
4:52
'Cause I feel like if you could listen
4:53
to all these politicians and sort through their issues,
4:55
then I know you can handle my baggage, baby.
4:59
The fuck I got a therapist for, okay?
5:01
I saved a hundred dollars last month
5:03
by telling my problems to my man.
5:05
(audience laughing)
5:07
I went to a women's health clinic.
5:09
It was like nine o'clock in the morning.
5:11
I had an appointment.
5:12
I'm standing outside smoking a vape pen.
5:14
I know it sounded like I was under a lot of stress
5:15
but I wasn't, I was just smoking a vape.
5:18
It was not a stressful day.
5:19
So I'm standing in front of this clinic
5:22
smoking this vape pen and like men do,
5:25
he walks past and says something to me
5:26
that he didn't even need to say.
5:30
But he walked past.
5:31
He was like, "Hey, baby."
5:34
"You know you too good looking to be smoking, right?"
5:39
I'm also too good looking for you to be talking to me.
5:41
But since we're doing things we shouldn't be doing
5:42
like what's up bro?
5:45
(audience laughing)
5:46
He's like, "What you smoking?"
5:48
It's clearly a vape pen.
5:49
It looks like a cartridge, a USB.
5:51
Like, what do you think I'm smoking, right?
5:53
But me being a comedian, I was like,
5:55
"Ha ha, I'm smoking crack."
5:57
(audience laughing)
5:58
Like I said this.
6:04
Y'all, why this man say, "Oh yeah"
6:07
and pull a crack pipe out his pocket.
6:09
(audience laughing)
6:11
And was like, "What's up baby?"
6:13
What the fuck?
6:17
I'm like, "Bro, I'm here to ruin somebody else's life,
6:19
not mine." and I pointed at the abortion sign.
6:22
Like what?
6:24
I wasn't there for an abortion though.
6:25
I was just there for birth control.
6:27
But like what?
6:28
And then it was the way he asked me like I was really going.
6:31
And then he jumped in his van and was like, "Are you sure?"
6:34
And I was like, "Yeah I'm sure."
6:37
He act like I needed a minute to think about it.
6:39
Like I don't need to second guess this decision.
6:42
And then his van had curtains so I know he lived in it.
6:45
(audience laughing)
6:46
'Cause the curtains matched
6:47
and they were on all the windows.
6:49
And why would you interior decorate your van
6:51
unless it was your home.
6:56
And so yeah bro, I'm good, but thanks.
7:00
The fuck.
7:02
I've been living in LA for about four years now.
7:07
And LA's fake happy.
7:10
A lot of people are fake happy.
7:11
They're just running around like,
7:12
"Oh, manifest, manifest, manifest.
7:14
Alignment, crystals, crystals crystals.
7:17
It's a full moon, ahhh.
7:18
Acai, let's go hiking."
7:21
(audience laughing)
7:24
Like, bitch, are you okay?
7:27
If I have another friend gimme some crystals
7:30
for my birthday or holiday.
7:32
'Cause I have so many on my bookshelf.
7:34
It's just like if you ain't got no money, just say that.
7:37
(audience laughing)
7:39
Quit giving me these rocks, bitch.
7:42
Cause they don't work, okay?
7:45
I sleep with 'em in my bed, a man ain't appear yet.
7:49
They in my panties right now.
7:51
Where he yet, okay?
7:52
The crystals don't work.
7:53
Stop fucking giving 'em out to me.
7:55
And they try to make you feel bad about working.
7:57
So many people in LA don't work and it's weird.
8:00
But when I first got out there I was hustling.
8:02
I had a couple of jobs.
8:03
I was doing standup, I was doing Postmates
8:06
I was doing Uber. I was hanging out with a group of girls,
8:08
one of which I thought was my friend.
8:10
She wasn't.
8:12
She was like, "So Brandi."
8:14
Her name was Jessica, it sound like she was fucked up.
8:16
(audience laughing)
8:18
She was like, "So Brandi, what do you do for work?"
8:20
I was like, "Oh I do standup I do Postmates
8:22
and I drive Uber.
8:23
And she was like, "Ew, Uber."
8:26
And I was like, "Yeah Uber, Jessica, what you do?"
8:29
She was like, "Oh me, I drive Lyft."
8:30
I was like, "Bitch, that's the same thing."
8:32
(audience laughing)
8:34
Like that's the same thing.
8:37
The fuck.
8:40
Before I moved out there, I lived in Chicago
8:42
and I was a social worker.
8:43
Yeah, I quit six years ago.
8:45
(audience cheering)
8:48
Followed my dreams.
8:50
I'm gonna tell you, I quit the realest way too.
8:52
I quit on some boss bitch shit.
8:56
If you watching this and you work at DHS, what's up?
8:59
(audience laughing)
9:01
But no, I knew I was gonna quit about a week before I quit.
9:04
I did some just real arrogant shit.
9:06
I got I do what I want tattooed on the back of my neck.
9:09
(audience cheering)
9:11
And just wore my hair in a ponytail to work
9:14
for the rest of the fucking week.
9:17
They were like, "Brandi, can you fax these papers?"
9:19
I was like, "Nope."
9:20
(audience laughing)
9:22
It was real bad.
9:24
But I liked working there not because they paid me anything,
9:28
but I liked working there 'cause I used to get hit on a lot.
9:31
Because I don't know if you guys have seen social workers,
9:33
but like I'm like a bad bitch social worker.
9:36
So I'm like at the top of the social worker chain.
9:40
So I used to get hit on by my clients which was weird
9:45
'cause it would always be after the interview.
9:48
Which is interesting.
9:50
Very interesting. You gotta have a lot of confidence
9:52
to hit on your social worker after the interview.
9:54
You just told me that you live in an underpass
9:56
you haven't had a job, you can't feed you.
9:59
I know you can't feed me.
10:00
So like, what are we doing?
10:05
What are we doing?
10:07
Some of them clients had some swag, you know?
10:09
Like you could feel big dick energy.
10:11
I don't care if you got a home or not.
10:13
Like they was throwing game and I was like,
10:15
"I don't know, I don't know."
10:17
(audience laughing)
10:19
I don't know.
10:23
But the best pickup line,
10:24
I was sitting in my office I was like,
10:26
"Today is a good day Michael.
10:28
You've been approved for the food stamps and Obamacare."
10:32
And he was like, "That's cool Ms. Denise."
10:34
And then he leaned back and he licked his lips.
10:39
And I was so happy that he lick his lips
10:41
'cause he had that white shit in the corner.
10:42
And I was like, "I am so happy that he did that."
10:45
'Cause don't you hate when you talking to somebody
10:46
and that shit be building up.
10:48
And you just be looking at it and you like, "Fuck, I gotta."
10:51
You start licking your lips like.
10:54
You ain't gonna get it? You just gonna let it sit there.
10:57
You just gonna foam?
10:58
You just gonna foam at the mouth?
10:59
Okay, okay okay.
11:01
So it got me thinking like
11:04
maybe I should get him my number
11:05
'cause they really don't pay me that much.
11:07
And I did just give him a food stamp card
11:09
with $917.13 cent on it.
11:12
And like we could go on a grocery shopping date,
11:15
you feel me?
11:15
(audience laughing)
11:17
Like I'm all in Whole Foods and I'm like,
11:18
"Baby where the motherfucking lobster and avocado at?"
11:22
He on aisle 17, "You have whatever you like."
11:27
Just foaming at the mouth.
11:28
But I don't give a fuck, he my man, you feel me?
