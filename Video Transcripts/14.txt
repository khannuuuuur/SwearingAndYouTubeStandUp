MAN: Houselights go.
0:05
MAN 2: Copy that.
0:05
MAN 3: Tonight is the night!
0:08
WOMAN: Talent's on the move.
0:09
WOMAN 2: Guys, have your tickets out.
0:10
(crowd chatter)
0:12
MAN 3: What's going on, Boston?
0:14
(audience cheering)
0:16
Welcome to Comedy Central's The Half Hour.
0:19
(cheering)
0:20
Put your hands together for Fortune Feimster.
0:23
(cheering)
0:36
Yes!
0:38
I've always wanted to come out like a pro wrestler.
0:40
(laughter) Little bit of that...
0:42
What?
0:44
(audience cheers) Yes!
0:45
(laughs)
0:48
(roars) What's up, Boston?
0:50
(loud cheering)
0:53
Yeah, I wore green for you guys.
0:55
You're welcome.
0:58
'Cause y'all are, like, Irish and (bleep).
1:01
I've also stayed out of the sun for many years
1:05
just for this moment in Boston, so...
1:08
Yeah.
1:09
It's pretty great.
1:10
I'm just really happy that I made it here.
1:13
I was almost late
1:15
catching my plane, 'cause I was teaching
1:17
a yoga class.
1:18
(man whoops, audience laughs)
1:19
(laughs) He's like, "That did not happen."
1:22
You're right, I did not teach a yoga class.
1:25
I went to one, obviously.
1:26
Look at this. Boom!
1:27
(whoops)
1:29
Ah.
1:30
Checkin' out my yoga booty.
1:32
Mmm...
1:34
It was pretty awesome, though, 'cause yoga teacher,
1:36
she let me do the modified version of everything.
1:38
So, like, the class would do downward dog
1:41
and she would let me eat raviolis.
1:46
They'd do a child's pose,
1:48
she'd let me take a nap in the corner.
1:51
I love yoga. Namaste.
1:55
Like they said, my name is Fortune.
1:58
Everybody looks at me really funny when I tell 'em my name.
2:00
They're like, "What's your name again?
2:01
Precious?"
2:08
No!
2:10
Or I'll get, like, Treasure
2:13
or Gracious.
2:15
Anything you could associate with a unicorn.
2:18
Or a stripper.
2:21
Do we have any strippers in here?
2:22
(woman whoops)
2:23
Are you really?
2:24
(laughs)
2:26
Yeah!
2:27
I mean, this is kind of a big night for strippers,
2:30
so if you're a stripper and you're here...
2:33
you're probably not a great one.
2:37
Yeah, I don't have the body of a stripper.
2:40
I would be, like, a Tuesday night stripper.
2:43
"I'm a Tuesday night stripper;
2:44
I'm working my way up to Sunday brunch."
2:50
Since I don't have the body of a stripper,
2:51
I would just use something, so I would...
2:54
I think I would just make really serious eye contact
2:56
with everybody, like this...
3:04
(cheering, man whooping)
3:17
That's why I'm a Tuesday night stripper.
3:21
Nah, genetics didn't work out for me,
3:23
so that's why I am a comic.
3:27
I figured my options were comedian,
3:29
softball coach or UPS driver.
3:34
I'm like, "Which one do I choose?!"
3:36
I picked comedy because I don't look good in brown.
3:40
That's not my color.
3:43
I do want to let you guys to know
3:44
my drink, it's right there,
3:45
in case you wanted to roofie me.
3:47
Huh?
3:50
Uh?
3:51
(chuckles)
3:53
I went to a women's college
3:54
where, like, the first month of my freshman year
3:56
they had a seminar on date rape like every week.
3:59
It gets funnier, I promise.
4:00
(laughter)
4:02
And their only advice was, uh...
4:04
their only advice to us is whenever we went to a party
4:07
and we had a drink in our hand
4:08
and some dude came anywhere near our vicinity,
4:11
all they told us to do was take our hand
4:13
and put it over our drink and go,
4:15
"No!
4:17
No!"
4:20
Guys would run away, like, "What the (bleep)?"
4:26
And it worked, too.
4:27
We never got laid.
4:36
And if you think about it,
4:37
it's only hot people that get pissed off
4:39
about being roofied.
4:41
(mouthing)
4:46
Every time I go to a bar,
4:47
I'm like, "My drink's in the corner.
4:49
It's completely unattended."
5:01
I'm not from around here, hence the...
5:04
very sophisticated accent.
5:06
I'm from North Carolina.
5:07
(audience cheers) (laughs)
5:08
Thank you.
5:10
Do y'all live there, or what?
5:11
You're like, "We just want to whoo!"
5:15
I miss my Southern grandma.
5:16
I feel like Southern grandmas have one goal in life,
5:19
and that's to make you and your dog fat.
5:21
When I was in middle school,
5:23
like, every day she'd feed me, like, fried chicken,
5:25
biscuits, gravy, mashed potatoes,
5:27
and that was just, like, an afternoon snack.
5:30
And whatever I didn't eat, she fed to my dog,
5:32
so I, of course, gained 50 pounds
5:34
and my dog started to look like a giant baby seal,
5:36
just like...
5:44
I was like, "Oh, my God.
5:46
"I cannot go to Kentucky Fried Chicken
5:48
"every day after school.
5:50
"I will never make it to high school
5:51
and I will definitely get dibetess."
5:55
That's what we call "diabetes" in the South.
5:57
It's "dibetess."
6:02
(laughs)
6:03
So one day, my grandmother came to pick me up from school
6:07
in her Chevy Caprice Classic, 'cause...
6:09
we were pretty fancy.
6:12
And I get in the front seat.
6:14
It's my grandma, me,
6:15
the giant baby seal dog
6:17
and a crocheted Kleenex box.
6:22
And my grandmother starts to drive
6:23
towards Kentucky Fried Chicken.
6:24
I'm like, "This is it.
6:26
I gotta say no. I have to say no."
6:27
And right as I am about to say no,
6:29
I make eye contact with my dog
6:31
and my dog looks at me
6:33
and all of a sudden says, "Don't (bleep) this up for me!"
6:40
And then goes right back to being
6:43
a giant baby seal dog.
6:48
Which is actually the same face that I make
6:50
when I wear skinny jeans.
6:55
"I can't feel my legs.
6:57
I cannot feel my legs."
7:03
My mom's so funny. She lives in the South, too.
7:05
She's still determined
7:06
to keep my up-to-date with everybody that I grew up with.
7:09
And she'll remind me about them to the point where I care again.
7:12
So, she'll call me up.
7:14
She's like, "Hey, what are you doing?"
7:15
I'm like, "Well, it's the 3:00 in the afternoon, cougar.
7:17
I'm working."
7:19
And she's like, "Well, do you remember Ashley Davidson?"
7:22
I'm like, "No, I don't know who that is."
7:25
"Oh, you know who that is!"
7:28
Like I was just lying the second before.
7:31
"Ashley Davidson!
7:34
"She had long, dark hair.
7:35
She was on the cheerleading squad."
7:36
I'm like, "No, Mom, it still does not ring a bell."
7:40
"Ashley Davidson!
7:44
Her mom Alice used to cut your hair."
7:47
And then I'm like, "Oh, yeah.
7:49
Yeah, I think I know who that is."
7:51
"Well, she's dead."
7:59
I'm like, "Why would you call to tell me that?"
8:00
She's like, "'Cause I thought you'd want to know."
8:02
I'm like, "But I didn't even know who that is!"
8:03
"Oh, you know who that is!"
8:06
We go round and round in circles.
8:08
This is an actual text
8:09
that she sent to me if you want
8:11
any idea of how she can brighten your day.
8:13
Here... is an example.
8:16
Real text. (quiet laugh)
8:18
"Did you know Vanessa Tate? She lived on Poplar Street.
8:21
"I went to school with her mother Jan.
8:24
"We were in junior league together back in the day.
8:27
"Her father died a few months ago and her mother last week.
8:31
"They were 65 and 61-- I wonder what happened?
8:33
Very sad."
8:41
Oh, it gets better, it gets better.
8:43
"There's snow in the air and it's 23 degrees.
8:47
"I feel sorry for the tornado survivors
8:49
"who are picking through the rubble of their homes in this.
8:51
Have a great show. Love, Mom."
9:03
Now you know
9:05
why I am like I am.
9:08
No, my mom's great. She's 67 and she's single.
9:11
And she's been hanging out at the bars a lot
9:13
with her friends who are also single.
9:15
They like to think of themselves as cougars,
9:17
but they're more like panda bears.
9:21
I said that to one of my mom's friends
9:23
who did not know what a cougar was,
9:25
and she was like, "Well, a panda bear's
9:27
just as dangerous as a cougar!"
9:30
Touché, lady panda.
9:33
Touché.
9:37
My mom's a bit of a lightweight.
9:38
It takes her one whiskey sour
9:40
and then she's, like, completely toasted.
9:42
WOMAN: Yeah! (laughs)
9:43
What? What? She's like, "Yeah!
9:45
"That's my style.
9:47
I want to hang out with your mom."
9:50
You can always tell when my mom's tipsy
9:53
'cause she'll stick one finger out just like this
9:54
and start dancing like this.
10:00
Just judging people while she's dancing.
10:07
Like she's some sassy black woman.
10:10
(laughs)
10:13
So... when I went home for Christmas,
10:15
I went out, uh, to a bar
10:17
with my mom 'cause that's what you do with your mom.
10:20
And the thing is when these songs come on, uh,
10:22
and she starts dancing, she has no idea what song
10:25
she is dancing to, so all of a sudden I hear
10:27
♪ To the window, to the wall
10:30
♪ Till the sweat drop down my balls ♪
10:33
♪ All you bitches crawl.
10:35
And I looked over and my mom's just dancing.
10:42
(singsongy): With her Christmas sweater on.
10:47
Or we heard that song
10:49
♪ Jump on it
10:51
♪ Let's do it, ride it
10:53
♪ My pony.
10:55
"Oh, I love horses!"
11:04
I'm like, "I'm pretty sure that's
11:05
not what that song is about."
11:06
"I don't care. I love horses."
11:13
You guys like the restaurant Hooters?
11:15
(audience whoops)
11:16
Do you? The gay guys are like,
11:19
"Mm."
11:21
There was a Hooters in my hometown that closed.
11:23
You know every time a Hooters closes,
11:25
an angel loses its wings? (laughs)
11:28
Pretty sure that's the saying.
11:31
I learned Hooters waitresses,
11:33
they get really suspicious when somebody comes in there
11:35
to buy one of their outfits.
11:36
And they get especially suspicious
11:38
when that person is me.
11:41
So, I went into Hooters and I went up to the waitress.
11:43
I was like, "Hey, I'd like to buy one of your shirts."
11:45
And she's like, "Um...
11:48
what size?"
11:50
I was like, "Duh.
11:52
Small."
11:54
She's like, "Well, they run kind of small."
11:56
I'm like, "Psh, even better! Lets do this!"
11:59
It's my goal in life to buy the entire Hooters outfit,
12:02
and just go into Hooters and start waiting on tables.
12:05
(women whoop)
12:07
I squeeze into those shorts.
12:08
I'm like... (screaming)
12:12
I hurt!
12:14
My gut's hanging out.
12:16
I walk in there, there's, like, these four dudes
12:18
watching football and they see me, they're like,
12:20
"What the...?
12:25
"No!
12:31
"No!
12:33
I didn't order that!"
12:37
You know, just walk in there like this.
12:40
(huffs)
12:43
(huffs)
12:46
"I'm real tired.
12:47
"I had to walk all the way over here.
12:50
"Do you want some chicken wings?
12:52
"Hmm?
12:53
Do you?"
12:55
I would, of course, have a wedgie right there.
12:57
Boom!
12:58
Camel toe. (laughs)
13:00
Someone just went... (groans)
13:05
You're never gonna look at chicken wings the same.
13:07
That's all I'm saying.
13:10
Yes, I am gay.
13:12
Unlike most gay people though,
13:13
I did not come out of the closet.
13:14
My name is Fortune, I came out of a cookie.
13:17
(audience laughing, cheering)
13:22
I was a late bloomer though.
13:24
I didn't come out until I was 25.
13:26
And I remember when I was in college,
13:27
my mom would be like,
13:28
"I don't understand why you get so upset
13:30
"when your friend Michelle
13:31
goes out on dates with guys."
13:33
And I was like,
13:34
(shouting): "Because she's my best...
13:36
friend!"
13:41
(screams)
13:43
You don't get it...!
13:46
Apparently, I did not get it.
13:49
I had no idea;
13:51
I dressed just like this, too.
13:52
No clue.
13:54
(laughs) When I finally decided
13:56
to come out, it was really scary...
13:58
especially telling your dad,
14:00
'cause, like, your dad's your dad, you know?
14:01
He's the one who teaches you how to play softball.
14:08
Which, is like, the gayest sport there is.
14:12
In fact, some people call it a gateway sport.
14:16
Yeah. Softball, then lesbian.
14:19
There's some straight girls in here right now,
14:21
that are like...
14:28
"Oh... my, God.
14:31
"Oh...
14:33
"my... God...!
14:36
"I played softball in high school.
14:39
"I was third base and I was really good.
14:42
What does this mean?!"
14:44
It means you're gay!
14:47
We're coming for you, grab the Subaru,
14:49
let's go...!
14:53
(laughter, cheering)
14:56
Put on your Tevas,
14:57
it's gonna be a long journey.
15:02
S... (laughs)
15:03
So, when I finally told my dad,
15:04
I took him to this hometown festival in the South,
15:07
to tell him. You know, safety in numbers.
15:10
And we're sitting there on this hill and I'm like,
15:12
so nervous, that I can barely speak.
15:14
I'm like, "Dad, uh... huh, (laughs)
15:17
"I need to tell you something.
15:18
"Um...
15:20
Dad, I'm gay."
15:24
(groaning words)
15:28
(groans): "I just want to say, I'm gay."
15:30
At this point, he's really worried,
15:31
because he thinks I'm special.
15:33
Which, sometimes I am.
15:35
So, finally, I'm like, "Dad, I'm gay."
15:37
And he cocks his head back and he's like, "Aw, (bleep)."
15:41
And he's more concerned about
15:43
having to have a real conversation,
15:44
so he's just like, "All right.
15:47
"Okay.
15:48
"All right.
15:51
(smacks lips)
15:52
"Okay.
15:54
"Well, uh...
15:55
You want to go to Old Navy and get you a new outfit?"
16:01
(laughing): I'm like, "What?!"
16:03
"They're having a sale, 30% off.
16:04
We'll go down there right now; we'll get you a new outfit."
16:07
I'm like, "Dad, what does Old Navy
16:09
have to do with me being a lesbian?"
16:10
He's like, "I don't know.
16:11
They sell vests and (bleep)."
16:14
I'm like, "Grab the Subaru, let's go!"
16:21
I've been wearing tiny vests and cardigans ever since.
16:23
(groans)
16:25
It's not me, it's the dryer.
16:30
My friends took me out for my birthday.
16:32
First of all, they took me to a straight bar;
16:35
clearly, my friends don't know me very well.
16:38
And it's one of those places
16:39
that make the birthday person
16:40
do something really embarrassing.
16:43
So, I was the proud recipient of
16:44
an alcoholic beverage known as a "(bleep) job."
16:48
Yeah. Know your audience.
16:52
So, the dude who owns the bar,
16:53
he comes out and he has this tray
16:55
and on this tray, he has this camera,
16:57
'cause they have, like, this (bleep) job wall of fame
16:59
where all the chicks who do this shot,
17:01
their picture's on the wall.
17:03
And then, they have a shot glass
17:05
with like, whip cream, all in it,
17:07
'cause, it's like, a (bleep) job.
17:09
I don't know much about that, sir, we'll figure it out.
17:15
And then, he has this T-shirt, but he comes out,
17:17
he's used to seeing these, like, really hot, wasted girls
17:20
do this shot.
17:21
He comes and he sees me, I'm like,
17:22
"Hey, it's my birthday!
17:25
"Hey, do I get some cake?
17:26
I love cake."
17:28
And he immediately takes his T-shirt
17:30
and he throws it to the bartender, he's like,
17:32
"Uh, we're gonna need to make that an extra large."
17:34
And I got pissed again, and this time when I got pissed,
17:36
my voice got deeper, I was like,
17:37
"I can hear you!"
17:40
I call it my fat girl voice.
17:42
I usually only use it
17:43
when I'm ordering fried food.
17:46
It's true, the next time you guys order crappy food,
17:48
you're gonna notice,
17:50
your voice gets deeper. You're like,
17:51
(deep voice): "I'll have the sampler platter
17:52
with onion rings and mozzarella sticks! Thanks!"
17:57
That's your fat girl voice.
17:59
You also have a skinny girl voice
18:00
when you order healthy food.
18:02
Everything's lighter, like, "I'll have a salad
18:03
"with dressing on the side.
18:06
"You know, that's too many calories,
18:08
"I'll just have a stick of gum.
18:10
"You know, that's gonna go straight to my hips,
18:12
I'll just drink air, I'm fine."
18:15
(laughs) That's your skinny girl voice.
18:16
Anyway... so the dude who owns the bar,
18:19
he gets this bar stool
18:21
and he puts it in the middle of the bar.
18:22
He sits this random guy on this stool,
18:25
who I've never met.
18:26
He takes that huge shot glass,
18:28
he puts it in the guy's crotch
18:30
and I'm supposed to take my face--
18:32
my gay face--
18:36
and I'm supposed to dive it headfirst,
18:38
into this guy's crotch,
18:40
grab this shot glass with my mouth
18:42
and pop it back like, "Everybody's having fun."
18:46
So, I went, "Nah, I'm good.
18:47
I'm gonna go get some cake."
18:49
And all the straight girls are like,
18:51
"It's so easy.
18:52
"You just have to open your mouth
18:54
"really wide and you just kind of get down on it,
18:55
you just have to get down on it."
18:57
Like, this, sir, you have to be like (groaning).
19:03
Yeah, look me in the eye, we're in this together.
19:06
(groaning)
19:10
I just made eye contact with weird people.
19:13
(laughing)
19:14
So, I went, "No, no, no. I'm good. I'm good. I'm good."
19:16
All of a sudden, the guy takes my face
19:18
and he shoves it in the shot glass.
19:20
I'm like, "Oh, my God! Oh, my God!"
19:21
And I cannot get my mouth around the shot glass.
19:22
I'm like, "Oh, my God! Oh, my God!"
19:24
And he's holding my head down there, like you (bleep) do.
19:26
I'm like, "(groans) No!
19:28
(screams) No!"
19:30
(screaming) And all of a sudden,
19:32
everybody starts chanting my name
19:34
and they're like, "Precious. Precious.
19:37
Precious. Precious."
19:39
And I cannot get my mouth around the shot glass
19:41
and I'm like, "Oh, my God! Oh, my God!"
19:42
And freaking unicorns are dying, babies are crying,
19:44
I cannot get my mouth around the shot--
19:45
"Oh, my God! Ruining my party. Oh, my God!"
19:47
And finally, I'm like, "I have TMJ!
19:51
(whimpers)
19:52
"I have TMJ.
19:54
It's a really serious jaw disorder."
19:56
(laughs) Needless to say,
19:58
I did not make it on the
20:00
(bleep) job wall of fame, you guys.
20:01
I know, I was just trying
20:04
to make my mom proud.
20:05
She has been on there three times, she's like,
20:07
(singsongy): "To the window, to the wall."
20:09
All right, you guys, that's my time.
20:12
(applause, cheering) Thank you!
