Oh, my goodness. Hello, New Orleans!
0:26
Look at you guys. This is so fun. This is pretty cool.
0:31
My life is going pretty well though, I have to say.
0:35
Earlier this year something pretty major happened for me.
0:38
I became an uncle for the first time,
0:40
- which was pretty cool. - ( cheers and applause )
0:42
Oh, thank you so much.
0:43
I had nothing to do with it, but cool.
0:46
I'll take the congratulations. Yeah, I became an uncle,
0:48
and that's really cool. I'm really excited. Less cool,
0:50
I have a very religious family and there were many people
0:56
in my family who are concerned about me being around the baby
0:58
because I am gay.
1:01
I know, which is sort of ridiculous 'cause it's like
1:03
nobody in my family has seen any of the guys that I've ( bleep )
1:06
'cause I can do so much better than some ( bleep ) baby, okay?
1:09
Like, come on.
1:10
Look at what I'm working with here, all right?
1:14
That baby wishes, all right?
1:17
My sister's baby should be so lucky at the end of the day.
1:22
My family is very, very Christian.
1:23
They're very evangelical Southern Baptist Christians.
1:27
They're so Christian that they home-schooled me
1:29
until I was 16 years old
1:31
because they did not want me learning about sex or evolution
1:34
and as like a fun fringe benefit of that,
1:36
now I don't know about states either, which is pretty cool.
1:39
Just never knowing where I am, you know?
1:44
I recently truthfully had to ask a friend
1:47
what is Oklahoma, you know,
1:48
because seems sort of unclear. Yeah, so not a lot
1:54
of practical knowledge going on up here in the old noggin,
1:58
but to sort of offset that, I am a nationally ranked Bible
2:00
quizzer, which is pretty cool. That's a thing.
2:02
Okay, got some weirdos in the audience too.
2:06
That's great.
2:08
So I know a lot about that,
2:10
but sort of on the flip side of that coin,
2:11
I've never used a condom, you know,
2:13
so it is a trade-off, in the sort of...
2:17
knowledge you learn.
2:18
Most of my family is from the South, actually.
2:21
Um, yeah, I love the South. They're great, they're great.
2:24
My mom is a real Southern lady.
2:26
She's one of these ladies who thinks that our generation,
2:28
well, we got too many participation trophies,
2:30
and that's why we are the way we are, you know?
2:33
Gay. That's what she pins that on.
2:36
But weirdly, my mom is also one of these people who's like,
2:39
"Oh, no, no. You cannot take that Robert E. Lee statue down
2:43
from my college campus, no, ma'am."
2:45
And it's like, "But, Mom, like, those
2:47
statues are history's greatest participation trophies,"
2:50
you know, like, y'all lost, all right?
2:53
We let you erect a statue, so...
2:57
think about that. Okay.
3:00
Was actually, um, I was actually adopted,
3:03
hence why my mom sounds like Foghorn Leghorn.
3:05
I know some of you were confused.
3:09
You were like, "Something does not fit."
3:12
Yeah, I was adopted from South Korea.
3:14
South Korea, for those of you-- you might know this,
3:17
it was the only country in the '80s
3:19
that would fly a baby to the U.S.
3:21
You did not have to go and pick it up,
3:22
so in many ways, it was like the Grubhub of babies, you know?
3:25
They would just fly a baby straight to your door.
3:30
No hassles, no fees. It was great.
3:32
But, you know, so it was an interesting thing for me growing
3:35
up with this face and an all-white family in an all-white
3:38
town. Like, I fully knew I was gay before I knew was Asian.
3:42
That's a sad-but-true fact about me.
3:45
It was quite the rude awakening when I finally found out, I have
3:48
to tell you. It was tough, but it's even tougher for me now
3:50
because, like, I don't meet a lot of, like, cultural
3:53
expectations of what an Asian person should be in this
3:56
country, you know? Like I'm terrible at math.
4:00
I don't know karate.
4:03
My dick is huge, you know?
4:04
So it's just like on and on and on.
4:07
Oh, God.
4:09
Just constantly disappointing white people, you know?
4:13
It's tough. I actually don't know if it's that big or not
4:16
'cause every time I look at it, it's pixilated,
4:19
so...sort of anybody's guess at that point. Okay.
4:24
So if you didn't laugh at that joke, be glad, okay?
4:26
That means you're pure of heart and mind.
4:29
The rest of you, shame.
4:32
Shame. We'll come back to that.
4:34
I am a terrible driver, though, so that might be genetic.
4:38
I've totaled three cars.
4:40
But actually, you guys,
4:41
I think that has more to do with being gay and sleeping with men
4:45
than it does have to do with being Asian
4:48
and anybody who sleeps with men in here,
4:49
you might be able to back me up on this.
4:51
Something about being lied to my entire sexual life
4:54
about what six inches looks like,
4:55
now my depth perception is ( bleep ), you know?
4:57
Like I can't parallel park.
4:59
Bumper to bumper traffic is a disaster for me.
5:02
How big is this microphone? 18 inches? I don't know, you know?
5:05
I just have so many sample sizes to choose from.
5:09
It's really tough.
5:11
So obviously as Christian as my parents are,
5:14
they did not take it super well when I came out of the closet,
5:17
mostly because I did not come out of the closet,
5:19
they read my journal when I was 17.
5:22
Um, yes, gasp is right.
5:25
It was rough because at that point in my life,
5:26
my journal was less of, like, an introspective
5:29
thoughts and dreams journal,
5:31
and more of just a Buzzfeed list of guys' ( bleep ) I was
5:33
sucking. You know, like, no content to sift through.
5:36
Just straight to the headlines.
5:39
It was clickbait for my parents.
5:40
They couldn't resist. They had to see it.
5:43
It was tough for them, but what's even funnier--
5:45
so I mentioned I was adopted, I have two adopted siblings.
5:48
They're biological to my mom and dad.
5:49
And I have an older brother, and a couple of years ago,
5:52
he also came out of the closet,
5:53
which is like..., you know, like...
5:55
( laughing ) I couldn't have planned a better prank,
5:58
you know, like that.
6:00
Oh, you punked them good, Jesus.
6:01
I can't-- oh, it's so funny.
6:05
It's so delicious to me 'cause my parents, they really, like,
6:07
they truly rolled the dice there, you know?
6:09
Like, they made one themselves, they got one off the rack,
6:11
and they both turned out gay, you know, like,
6:14
I don't know what the scientific argument is there,
6:16
but that feels like nurture, bitch, okay?
6:19
That feels like your fault.
6:21
What was going on there?
6:22
Bet you wish you didn't vaccinate us now, Mom and Dad,
6:26
huh? Do you want two sons without polio
6:28
or two straight sons? You can't have it all, all right?
6:31
You gotta give some stuff up.
6:33
Now again, I am just joking.
6:35
I love vaccines, okay? I can't get enough.
6:38
Every time a new one comes out, I'm just like,
6:40
rawr, rawr, rawr, you know?
6:42
I just love it.
6:44
My poor dad. Oh, goodness.
6:46
He's been through the ringer. It was really hard for him.
6:49
My dad is sort of like an amateur pastor in a lot of ways.
6:52
Like, we didn't go to a church growing up.
6:55
We had church at home led by my dad
6:57
and, oh, my God, yes.
6:59
Now that I'm saying it, I was in a cult.
7:01
That's what that is.
7:03
It's not a church at all.
7:05
But, yeah, he had a real rough time with me growing up.
7:08
I was a real shit kid. I was difficult to raise.
7:10
I remember when I was 13, we had a fight hat was so
7:13
outrageous that my dad tried to exorcise me in the middle of the
7:19
fight. And when I realized what he was doing,
7:21
I just started to laugh maniacally in his face,
7:24
which in hindsight did not help my case, you know?
7:27
Like, that seems like something a demon might do in
7:31
that sitatuon. Might as well just crab-walked across
7:33
the living room floor, spinning my head around,
7:34
spewing puke everywhere, you know?
7:37
I don't know. It was weird growing up in the Midwest
7:39
with my situation because, like, I find that
7:42
my life now is just a never-ending guessing game
7:45
of where are you really from, you know?
7:48
It's just exhausting to get it all the time.
7:50
Like, I was at a party recently, and a guy I did not even know
7:52
approached me from across the party,
7:54
and without even knowing my name,
7:55
the first words out of his lips were, "Um, I'm sorry,
7:58
but what, um, what kind are you?"
8:00
Like I'm some sort of unmarked dessert on a buffet bar, you
8:03
know? Like, it was just that casual.
8:04
And it's so frustrating. It's like, fine,
8:06
I don't mind having the conversation.
8:08
I don't mind answering the questions.
8:09
It just never turns into an interesting conversation,
8:13
you know? Like, every single day just like,
8:14
"Oh, I'm from South Korea," and they're like, "Oh, cool.
8:17
I taught English in South Korea for a year,"
8:18
and I'm like, "Awesome. I knew some D students in high school
8:21
who needed to escape too." You know, like, we all know 'em.
8:24
- Okay, good. Some of you knew some people
8:26
who needed to flee.
8:28
That's good. It's just frustra--
8:30
I don't know. It was never worse--
8:31
I worked at the Olive Garden for two years.
8:34
Hold for applause, okay. - ( applause )
8:36
- Wow, some of you think you're too good
8:39
to clap for the Olive Garden. Well...
8:43
have I got something to tell you, you're not.
8:46
No, I love the Olive Garden. I worked there for a while,
8:49
and I remember this one time I approached this table.
8:51
It was like three elderly white guys and, you know,
8:54
we, you know, exchanged pleasantries
8:56
and then at one point, one of the guys at the table was like,
8:58
"Say, son, are you Korean?"
9:00
And I was like, "Oh, my God. That's an amazing guess.
9:02
How did you know that? And he was like, "Well,
9:04
I fought in the Korean War, so I know a thing or two about this."
9:07
And I was like, "What does this mean four our relationship now?
9:12
Do you need a new server?
9:13
Are you going to have a flashback or something?
9:15
Like, what's going on?"
9:17
Like, it's almost worse when people guess correctly.
9:20
Like, I met this guy on a dating app and we exchanged numbers
9:22
and we were texting back and forth,
9:24
and out of the blue at one point, he was like, "So you're
9:26
Korean, right?" And then I was like, "Yeah, that's amazing.
9:29
Like, how did you guess that?" And he was like, "Your eye
9:31
shape." And then I was like, "Ugh. Like, are you gonna
9:34
measure my skull next? Like, what-- where are we
9:36
going with this?" And the weirder thing is is that I
9:39
hadn't sent him any pictures of my face. I had only sent him
9:41
pictures of my butthole, so I don't know what eye shape he was
9:45
talking about. Very confusing. Very confusing.
9:50
Deal with a lot of questions about my race,
9:52
but one question I get a lot,
9:55
and it's sort of like a jokey question--
9:57
I-- you-- you probably get it too.
9:59
Do you get, like, a jokey question that bugs you?
10:02
Okay, so on the count of three, we're going to say the question
10:06
that we get at the same time, and hopefully it's the
10:10
same question because this is on TV, okay?
10:15
This is a big life moment for me.
10:19
So if you mess this up,
10:22
just think about-- have that weight on your shoulders
10:25
as I count down from three, okay?
10:29
One, two, three.
10:31
Do you eat dog? Okay, you didn't say anything.
10:35
Outrageous.
10:37
No, that's the question-- people think they're so clever,
10:40
like they're the first person to ever, like,
10:41
ask me this question, "Do you eat dog?"
10:43
And it used to piss me off and, like, upset me
10:45
'cause I get it, like, I know why you're asking the question.
10:48
But at this point in my life, I'm like,
10:50
"Yeah. I would ( bleep ) eat a dog. Why not?"
10:53
I eat all the other meats. Doesn't seem like an issue.
10:56
Okay, I'm losing you. I can sense that.
11:00
But-- but-- but bear with me. There's a point to this.
11:02
Do I have any dog owners in the audience tonight?
11:04
Make some noise if you're a dog owner.
11:05
- ( cheers and applause ) - Okay, you guys have dogs.
11:07
Here's the thing. I would eat your dog sight unseen, I would.
11:11
You don't even have to show me a picture.
11:13
I just know that I would eat it
11:15
if it were presented to me, if it were cooked nicely, you know.
11:19
But the thing is is that's the line for me.
11:22
Like, there's all these ads in New York right now that PETA has
11:24
that has, like, a spectrum of animals
11:26
and it's got, like, a pig on one side and a dog on the other,
11:28
and it's like, "Why would you eat this pig, but you won't eat
11:31
that dog?" And it's like, "Because I've never met
11:34
that pig, okay?" If I knew its first name, that might
11:36
change things. That's the message of "Charlotte's Web,"
11:39
it really is. Is you can eat any old pig you want,
11:40
as long as it doesn't have an inner life, you know?
11:42
And that's where things get really dicey.
11:44
Like, what they need to do is do what they do
11:47
with cigarette packs in Europe, you know?
11:49
They put, like, blackened lungs on the outside of the packs.
11:51
If they would just put facts about the cows on the burger
11:55
patties, I'd never eat another goddamn burger, you know?
11:57
If it was just like, "This is Daisy.
11:59
Her favorite color is blue," and I'd be like,
12:01
"I can't eat Daisy. She likes 'Magnolia.' I love that movie.
12:05
We have too much in common. I can't do it."
12:09
I'm not super into animals.
12:11
I'm scared of them most days. Like, I get really anxious.
12:15
Like, please stop sharing these videos of crows
12:19
that have learned how to talk and can use tools.
12:20
I don't want to see it. Stay in your own lane, crows.
12:24
Talking and using tools is sort of our thing, all right?
12:27
People are afraid that immigrants are gonna come in and
12:29
take their jobs. They should be worried about the crows, okay?
12:32
They're the real threat. Like, sir, what do you do for a
12:35
living? A librarian? A crow could do that in a second.
12:38
You should see some of the things these crows are doing.
12:41
Animals are terrible. I find bees to be high strung, you
12:46
know? Every single bee wakes up in the morning and is like,
12:48
"If that person even looks at me wrong, I will kill myself!"
12:54
Like, take it down a notch, okay?
12:58
Chill out. I do-- I am a cat person.
13:01
That might not shock any of you.
13:02
- ( cheers and applause ) - Yes, thank you.
13:05
I am-- I love-- I have two cats at home.
13:07
Their names are Lea Michele and Little Richard.
13:10
Those are my cats. I love my cats. Here's a fun fact
13:12
about the difference between cats and dogs.
13:14
If you live alone with a dog and you die,
13:18
it'll take the dog three weeks to begin to eat you
13:21
and it'll start at the fingers.
13:22
If you live alone with a cat and you die alone,
13:25
it'll take three days and it'll start at the face.
13:29
Sort of a fundamental difference,
13:30
but here's the thing about my cats
13:32
is they don't even wait that long.
13:34
Every single night I wake up about four hours into sleep
13:39
to them eating me.
13:42
And every single night they're just like,
13:44
"Oh, my God, I'm sorry. Were you not dead?"
13:47
"Oh, my God, this is so embarrassing. We thought you
13:50
were dead. You just-- you had your eyes closed
13:54
for so long. This feels like your fault, not ours.
13:57
No, no, no, you go back to sleep. We'll be back."
14:03
Were you guys here together?
14:05
Aww, that's sweet.
14:08
You guys in love?
14:10
You are? She didn't answer yet.
14:14
Strange. She still looks a little shell-shocked.
14:16
Maybe you should have checked in before you answered.
14:18
Real quick made sure that those feelings are
14:20
reciprocated. How'd you do that?
14:27
How'd you come to be in love? Well, you're not gonna say--
14:33
are there single people in here tonight?
14:37
- Make some noise if you're single.
14:38
Okay, so now you're withholding information
14:42
from the rest of us, okay?
14:44
So cough it up.
14:45
How-- what's like-- how do you guys maintain your relationship?
14:48
Like, what's a word of advice that you would have for me?
14:50
And, like, how do you keep-- keep him from fleeing, you know?
14:54
The same for you.
14:56
- Conversation. - Conversation?
14:59
- Wow. - ( laughter )
15:03
Oh, God. Oh, no, please stop. You're making me horny.
15:07
( chuckles ) Conversation.
15:10
That's ridiculous.
15:13
If you don't want to tell me the truth, you just can say so.
15:16
You know, you don't have to make up stories.
15:19
That's fine. Thank you so much for your help.
15:23
No, I'm fascinated with people who manage to, you know,
15:26
make it work, stay in love.
15:28
I recently just went through my first break-up ever,
15:31
which was tough. - Audience: Aww.
15:34
- Thank you. No, you know, it's fine. Whatever.
15:36
You know what, you guys?
15:38
It means less when I have to ask for it, okay?
15:41
It really does, but appreciated.
15:43
Yeah, it was a really tough break-up on me.
15:46
Within three days of the break-up,
15:47
I cut off all my hair, started crying in public,
15:50
and doing yoga for the first time.
15:52
And I was like, "Oh, my God. I'm turning into a white woman.
15:56
What's happening to me?
15:58
I'm changing!"
16:01
The yoga has been very helpful though. I like that a lot.
16:03
At the beginning of yoga class, they ask you to do this thing,
16:06
they ask you to set your intention,
16:08
and I always set my intention for revenge.
16:11
( chuckles ) And I found that to be very therapeutic.
16:16
Really has been great. Oh, being single is the worst, you guys,
16:20
it really is. I know it's cliché to talk about,
16:22
but it's very difficult to be single right now.
16:25
Like, since the break-up,
16:27
I've been stood up on three different first dates by three
16:31
different men. Yeah, that's not even made up for the joke.
16:33
It's real. And it's tough.
16:35
Yeah, I know. I think the hardest part about that for me,
16:38
though, is just not knowing how those men died, you know?
16:40
Like, what happened to them?
16:44
Was it a grease fire? Some sort of animal attack?
16:47
It's the not knowing that hurts the most, you know?
16:49
It's very difficult. I don't know.
16:51
I'm just scared, you know? I'm panicking a little bit
16:54
about being single. I was single for eight years before I met
16:57
this last guy, and now I'm just afraid that it's gonna be
16:59
another eight years. I gonna turn 44, and I'll have had
17:02
nobody in that time span, you know? And that's a really scary
17:04
prospect for me. - Man: Aww.
17:06
- Okay, no, no, no. Wrong. You're reading my
17:10
cues incorrectly. It's crazy to me because I just gave you
17:15
so much time to do that math in your head,
17:18
and a single one of you mother( bleep ) gasped,
17:22
pulled your hair out in shock and agony at my age.
17:25
I am not 36 years old.
17:29
How dare you?
17:31
Listen, I get that that was more of a lie
17:33
and less of a joke, but I think the premise of the joke
17:36
that I would ever turn 30 is hilarious, you know?
17:41
'Cause it's not gonna happen.
17:43
Turning 30 is a lifestyle choice,
17:46
and it's not one that I agree with.
17:48
You know, hate the sin, love the sinner,
17:50
that sort of thing.
17:52
No, no, it's not for me. I won't be turning 30.
17:54
On the eve of my 30th birthday, we'll be walking into the river
17:56
with a pocket full of rocks.
17:58
That's how I plan on handling that.
18:01
I get why you guys might think that I was 36, though,
18:04
because I will look like this forever.
18:07
Until the day I suddenly and without warning
18:10
look like a pillar of salt ready to disintegrate into the wind,
18:13
you know? Sort of the deal we signed with the devil.
18:17
It's tragic, really.
18:19
But it's better than aging like you guys.
18:24
You guys have been so much fun,
18:26
but unfortunately we're sort of at the end of our time together
18:30
now. I know. It's gone by so fast.
18:31
But I want to leave you with, like, my favorite
18:34
sort of story to tell audiences. It's about me growing up.
18:37
Like, when I was growing up, I was a pretty gay kid,
18:40
which is sort of a ridiculous premise for a joke
18:43
because what does that mean to say a child is gay?
18:46
Like, there's not a six-year-old walking around this country
18:48
crushing puss right now, okay?
18:49
Like, I don't know what it means.
18:51
But for the sake of my story, I was a pretty gay kid,
18:55
and it was never more apparent to me or my family
18:58
than Christmas, 1994. I wanted what every
19:00
little boy in the nation wanted for Christmas that year.
19:05
Say itwith me. The crimp and curl pony by the Cabbage Patch
19:08
Company. Okay, um, again left hanging.
19:13
Whatever. The crimp and curl pony, I wanted it.
19:15
My mom was super cool. She got it for me.
19:16
I opened it up on Christmas morning.
19:18
I just started crimping and curling right away, you know?
19:20
Couldn't resist. My dad, less enthused.
19:23
He looked at my mom and he was like,
19:25
"Janet, what the ( bleep )?" Like, "This is a girl's toy.
19:29
This is a toy for little girls. Why would you get him this?"
19:31
And my mom looked at my dad in his eyes and said,
19:34
"Well, Ken, my brother, Bob, he used to get baby dolls for
19:38
Christmas, and now he's a pediatrician, so...
19:42
Connect the dots."
19:44
And I was-- and my dad was just like,
19:47
"What the ( bleep ) do you think he's gonna be?
19:48
A ( bleep ) horse hair stylist? Like, what's the end
19:54
game here, Janet?" And you know, I remember my dad saying that,
20:01
you know, and I was just six years old
20:03
and I re-- I remember thinking
20:10
"Is that a profession? Is that something that I can do?
20:13
Like, does it require a college degree?
20:15
Like, how can I make that happen, Dad?
20:18
Don't leave me hanging."
20:19
All right, I've been Joel Kim Booster.
20:21
You guys have been ( bleep ) fantastic.
