UN.
0:05
WE GO TO A CLUB, YOU KNOW.
0:07
GUY'LL COME OVER, "HEY, CAN I BUY YOU A DRINK ?"
0:09
THEY'RE LIKE "UH-UH, NO, NO, SHE'S MARRIED."
0:12
I'M LIKE, "YEAH, I'M MARRIED, BUT I'M THIRSTY.
0:14
"WHY DON'T YOU SHUT THE HELL UP ?
0:16
LET ME HAVE A FREE DRINK."
0:19
'CAUSE WOMEN LOVE FREE DRINKS, WE DO.
0:22
BUT I NOTICED SOMETHING,
0:24
GUYS DON'T BUY YOU FREE DRINKS LIKE THEY USED TO.
0:26
THEY DON'T, RIGHT ?
0:28
REMEMBER THE GOOD OLD DAYS ?
0:29
REMEMBER THE GOOD OLD DAYS ?
0:31
YOU'D GO TO YOUR LOCAL BAR,
0:33
AND THE BARTENDER WOULD COME OVER AND SAY, "EXCUSE ME, MA'AM,
0:35
"THE GENTLEMAN WAY OVER THERE IN THE CORNER,
0:37
HE WOULD LIKE TO BUY YOU A DRINK."
0:39
YOU WOULD SAY "OKAY, THANK YOU, BEAUTIFUL."
0:41
AND YOU WOULD GET YOUR DRINK,
0:42
AND THE GREATEST THING OF ALL,
0:44
HE WOULD KEEP HIS ASS WAY OVER THERE IN THE CORNER
0:48
AND LEAVE YOU THE HELL ALONE.
0:50
AND LET YOU ENJOY YOUR PEACE IN PRIVATE.
0:53
ALL YOU HAD TO DO WAS SHAKE IT AT HIM.
0:56
"THANK YOU... THANK YOU."
1:01
"NO, STAY OVER THERE."
1:08
NOW, GUYS DON'T DO THAT NOW.
1:11
UH-UH, NO, HELL NO.
1:13
A GUY BUYS YOU A DRINK NOW,
1:14
HE THINKS THAT GIVES HIM THE RIGHT
1:15
TO STALK YOU FOR THE REST OF THE NIGHT.
1:18
HE'S IN YOUR FACE BEFORE THE DRINK GETS THERE.
1:20
YOU KNOW THAT GUY.
1:22
"HA, HA, HA...
1:26
"HOW YOU DOING, GIRL, HOW YOU DOING ?
1:29
"YEAH, YOU CAN CALL ME 'DRINK MAN'.
1:33
"WHAT'S YOUR NAME, WHAT'S YOUR NAME ?
1:35
"WANDA, MMM, WANNY WAN...
1:39
"WANDA, WANDA.
1:41
"I'M 'WANDA-RING' HOW YOU GONNA PAY ME BACK
1:43
FOR THAT DRINK LATER ON."
1:51
YOU GO TO THE LADIES ROOM,
1:53
YOU COME OUT, HE'S LEANING AGAINST THE SINK.
1:55
"WELL, WELL, WELL, WE MEET AGAIN.
1:59
"DRINK MAN.
2:02
"GIRL, YOU KEEP THIS UP,
2:03
I'M GONNA THINK YOU FOLLOWING ME."
2:09
YOU ON THE DANCE FLOOR, JUST HAVING A GOOD TIME.
2:12
LIKE, "WOO, YEAH," YOU TURN AROUND,
2:14
"AH, AH... REMEMBER ME ?
2:19
"DRINK MAN, UNH, YEAH.
2:24
"COME ON, GIRL, I PAID FOR THAT DRINK.
2:27
YOU OWE ME."
2:28
YOU LIKE, "LOOK, YOU GAVE ME A DRINK NOT A KIDNEY.
2:30
YOU BETTER GET THE HELL AWAY FROM ME."
2:37
I THINK WITH MEN AND WOMEN,
2:38
IT COMES DOWN TO SEX, YOU KNOW ?
2:40
WE'RE ON DIFFERENT LEVELS WHEN IT COMES TO SEX.
2:42
IT'S SOMETHING IN MEN,
2:44
THAT'S WHY THERE'S STILL PEOPLE WALKING AROUND THE EARTH.
2:46
THERE'S SOMETHING INNATE.
2:47
I THINK MEN HAVE SOMETHING IN THERE, WHERE THEY'RE LIKE,
2:50
"HEY, WE GOTTA MAKE MORE PEOPLE.
2:51
WE GOTTA MAKE MORE PEOPLE, WE GOTTA MAKE MORE PEOPLE."
2:53
AND WOMEN ARE LIKE,
2:54
"WHO THE HELL GONNA TAKE CARE OF ALL THESE PEOPLE ?
2:56
HEY, GET OFF ME !"
2:59
MEN AND WOMEN,
3:00
WE'RE JUST ON DIFFERENT LEVELS WHEN IT COMES TO SEX.
3:02
LIKE, LOOK AT THE PORNO INDUSTRY.
3:04
THAT'S A BILLION-DOLLAR INDUSTRY
3:06
AND MEN SUPPORT IT, THEY ACT OUT THEIR FANTASIES.
3:08
AND WHAT'S THE #1 FANTASY FOR MOST GUYS ?
3:09
WHAT IS IT, LADIES ?
3:11
TWO WOMEN, EXACTLY, TWO GIRLS, THAT'S WHAT THEY WANT,
3:13
TWO WOMEN.
3:14
THIS GREEDY BASTARD SAID THREE.
3:17
( laughter )
3:21
THAT'S FOR INFLATION, HUH ?
3:25
THAT'S WHAT THEY WANT, TWO WOMEN.
3:28
FELLAS, I THINK THAT'S A BIT LOFTY.
3:30
'CAUSE, COME ON, THINK ABOUT IT,
3:32
IF YOU CAN'T SATISFY THAT ONE WOMAN,
3:34
WHY DO YOU WANNA PISS OFF ANOTHER ONE ?
3:39
WHY HAVE TWO ANGRY WOMEN IN THE BED WITH YOU
3:41
AT THE SAME TIME ?
3:43
THINK ABOUT IT.
3:45
YOU KNOW HOW MUCH YOU HATE TO TALK AFTER SEX.
3:47
IMAGINE HAVING TWO WOMEN JUST NAGGING YOU TO DEATH.
3:51
"SO WHAT ARE YOU THINKING ?
3:55
COME ON, LET'S TALK."
3:57
"HOLD ME.
4:00
WE NEVER CUDDLE."
4:08
THAT'S THE THING, MAN, TWO WOMEN, TWO WOMEN.
4:10
THAT'S PROOF RIGHT THERE
4:12
THAT MEN AND WOMEN ARE ON DIFFERENT LEVELS.
4:14
'CAUSE MEN CAN WATCH TWO WOMEN TOGETHER,
4:17
AND THAT'S A TURN-ON.
4:18
DOESN'T WORK THE SAME WAY FOR US, DOES IT, LADIES ?
4:21
NO, UH-UH, SEE, EVERYBODY'S "UGHHH".
4:23
NO, SEE ?
4:24
NO, DOESN'T WORK THE SAME.
4:26
YOU ASK ANY WOMAN IN HERE HER SEXUAL FANTASY,
4:28
AND I WILL BET YOU A MILLION DOLLARS
4:30
THAT IT'S NOT TO GO HOME AND CATCH YOUR MAN
4:31
BENT OVER WITH SOME BIG BURLY GUY STANDING BEHIND HIM.
4:34
"OH, YEAH.
4:36
"SAY MY NAME, SAY MY NAME !
4:40
WHO'S YOUR DADDY, WHO'S THE DADDY ?!"
4:48
WOO, THAT'LL RUIN YOUR DAY.
4:50
WHAT DO YOU SAY THERE ?
4:52
WALK IN, "WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON HERE ?!"
4:56
YOU DON'T WANNA CATCH YOUR HUSBAND
4:58
SHARING A WARM BUBBLE BATH
4:59
WITH HIS NEW BOWLING PARTNER.
5:02
WHAT DO YOU SAY TO THAT ?
5:04
YOU WALK IN,
5:05
"WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON HERE ?"
5:07
"CALM DOWN, HONEY,
5:08
"I BOWLED A PERFECT GAME.
5:11
HE BOUGHT ME A DRINK."
5:13
THE GUY TURNS AROUND... "AH, HA !
5:17
"REMEMBER ME ?
5:19
