0:08
(audience cheers) (upbeat music)
0:22
- All right.
0:26
Hey. - Hey.
0:28
- I'm happy to be here.
0:31
This is groundbreaking right here, man.
0:33
I appreciate this, man.
0:34
Thanks for coming out.
0:36
I'm gonna do some jokes,
0:38
and you know, hopefully they work,
0:42
and if they don't, I don't live here, so it don't matter
0:46
or nothing like that, so.
0:48
I'm just gonna try some jokes out real quick.
0:50
See if they work or whatever.
0:55
Okay, start this off with something they might like.
1:00
Okay. Let me see.
1:04
Okay, cool.
1:06
I like drinking vodka and cranberry.
1:09
That's my drink.
1:11
That way you able to get messed up
1:12
and clean your system out at the same time.
1:17
I like to stay even when I get messed up.
1:20
Like I just found out fish is brain food.
1:22
It enhance your brain cells and that's good to know,
1:25
'cause weed kill your brain cells.
1:27
So if I eat some fish after every joint,
1:32
I should be even again, right? (audience applauds)
1:40
Yeah. I might just start smoking fish.
1:45
Just cut the middle man out.
1:48
I remember one time I tried to get high,
1:50
I didn't have no weed,
1:52
and my little Hispanic homie was like,
1:53
"Deon, homes, if you don't have no weed,
1:55
take some cigarettes, dip 'em in some cold medicine,
1:59
dry 'em and smoke 'em, you'll be messed up."
2:03
I'm like, "Forget you Pepe,
2:04
I ain't about to do that."
2:06
About a week later,
2:07
I'm over my cousin's house playing PlayStation.
2:08
I'm like, "You got some cold medicine?"
2:13
He was like, "You got some cigarettes?"
2:16
I'm like, "Yeah."
2:17
We dipped and dried 'em,
2:18
smoked them five minutes later.
2:20
I was like (laughs) "I'm high as hell."
2:24
But we wasn't high, we was just sleepy.
2:28
I ain't had a chest cold since that happened.
2:33
If there's any drug dealers in the house,
2:34
I just wanna tell you from the bottom of my heart,
2:36
keep up the good work.
2:38
Don't get caught.
2:40
People like me need you out here, all right?
2:42
The guy I was buying weed from in Chicago, he died,
2:45
and it hurt my soul, too.
2:47
I just wanna tell the drug dealers,
2:48
you can't be out on the streets
2:49
acting any kinda way you want to,
2:51
getting shot and stabbed and stuff.
2:53
I mean, you got responsibilities, you know?
2:57
(audience laughs and applauds)
3:01
I mean, you gotta think about your customers, you know?
3:04
I mean, if you die, how we gonna get high?
3:06
See how that works?
3:08
Went to this guy's house to get some weed.
3:09
His sister answered the door.
3:10
I'm like, "Hey, Rita, tell Snake
3:12
I wanna get a little 20 sack."
3:13
She like, "Deon, Snake dead."
3:15
I'm like, "What?"
3:18
So there ain't no weed here?
3:22
How he gonna die and take the weed with him, huh?
3:25
One time I messed up my mother real bad.
3:27
Like my mother a Christian, like she a super Christian.
3:31
Like she go to church with a cape on.
3:34
(audience laughs)
3:37
I messed up real bad with her one time.
3:39
She was in the house praying
3:40
and reading the Bible with her friends,
3:42
me and my friend outside.
3:43
We smoking on something
3:44
and my boy like, "Hey man,
3:47
let's go in your house and order a pizza, all right?"
3:49
And I'm like, "Nah, man, my mom in there praying
3:52
and reading the Bible with her friends.
3:54
Plus we gonna be too loud."
3:55
He like, "We ain't gonna be too loud, all right?
4:01
I ain't no prayer hater or nothing like that,
4:03
but I'm hungry as hell
4:04
and I wouldn't do this if we was at my house."
4:06
I hate peer pressure.
4:07
So I'm like, "Come on, man."
4:10
So we go in the house to order this pizza
4:11
and while we're waiting on the pizza to come,
4:12
we having man talk, talking about women, sex,
4:16
(beep)
4:17
It was basically that,
4:19
what we was talking about, whatever, but.
4:22
I don't know if y'all got this around y'all neighborhood,
4:24
but in Chicago, we got the ghettoest pizza places
4:27
in the world.
4:28
They don't even have no delivery man.
4:29
They give your pizza to whoever going your way.
4:32
(audience laughs)
4:37
I'm telling you, man, I open my door,
4:39
they be sending crack heads and drug dealers.
4:43
Open my door, there's a pimp standing there
4:44
with two bitches, just standing there.
4:47
He wasn't holding my pizza like this.
4:48
He was holding it like this.
4:50
Like it was a portfolio or something, just chilling.
4:55
I'm like, "Turn my pizza up."
4:57
We get the pizza. We start eating.
4:59
And I start thinking, man, my mom went to church today.
5:01
I should go see if she wants some of this pizza.
5:03
So I go in her room, I'm high as a meat coat.
5:06
Knock on the door.
5:07
I'm like, "Hey, what's up mommy? (laughs)
5:12
Oh, what's so funny?
5:14
Oh no, I was just laughing at something my friend said
5:16
in the room.
5:17
I ain't want to disturb y'all from praying
5:19
and reading the Bible.
5:20
I just came in to see if y'all wanted a piece of (beep).
5:24
(audience laughs)
5:39
Mama. (audience laughs)
5:42
Mama, the devil been taking over my soul all week."
5:46
(audience applauds)
6:22
Sometime I get real deep with stuff.
6:24
Can you imagine? Check this out.
6:26
How about if we all had the power
6:27
to just think about where we want to be at
6:29
and we could just be there?
6:31
Wouldn't that be cool?
6:33
I get deep.
6:34
Let me tell you how deep I get before I get off
6:35
into this joke.
6:36
Imagine if everybody in here right now,
6:38
imagine if we all walked outside right now,
6:41
and we were already there.
6:44
(audience laughs)
6:46
Smoke one, you'll know what I'm talking about,
6:48
I promise you. (audience laughs)
6:52
Imagine if you could just think about where you want
6:54
to be at and you could just be there.
6:55
Wouldn't that be cool?
6:57
'Cause I know some of y'all sitting out here right now
6:59
like, "Man, I gotta drive all the way over here,
7:00
drop them off, come all the way over here,
7:02
pick my kids up, and go all the way home."
7:04
And the only thing you could do is do this,
7:06
"I wish I was at home in my bed chilling."
7:08
And you'd go, "Home."
7:11
Be right in your bed, chilling.
7:12
If you could do that,
7:14
and I know if I had powers like that, I'd be like,
7:15
"I got powers like this?
7:17
Okay, I wanna be in the downtown national bank vault.
7:21
Hum."
7:24
Get in there and take all the money and be like,
7:25
"Okay, liquor store, reefer spot, and my woman house.
7:28
Hum."
7:33
You'll be trying to get money out the cash station,
7:35
getting robbed.
7:36
Do do, do, do. Guy come up behind you.
7:37
"Freeze, withdraw everything now
7:39
or I'll blow your head off."
7:40
I'd have been like, "Hum."
7:46
He'd be like, "Pow, pow, pow.
7:48
Where he go to?"
7:49
I'd have been right behind him like, "Hum.
7:52
Trying to rob me, bastard? Huh?"
7:54
(audience laughs)
7:57
You couldn't cheat on your woman either.
7:59
Right, you over somebody else going, "Who's is it?
8:01
Who is it?"
8:02
She at home like, "He ain't called yet?
8:06
I bet he over Fuquanda house.
8:09
I wanna be in the bitch closet. Hum."
8:15
Get up in the closet, see you in there,
8:16
she like, "Ah, I knew he was cheating on me, I knew it!
8:20
Forget it, to the nearest gun shop. Hum.
8:25
Yeah, lemme see that nine millimeter right there.
8:26
Yeah, the clip come with it? Infrared?
8:28
I'll take this."
8:29
"Okay, ma'am that'll be 400 and-"
8:31
"Hum." (audience laughs)
8:35
Then bang down the closet. Boom.
8:36
"Freeze, Deon! I knew you was cheating on me.
8:40
You leaving me at home
8:41
with them little nappy headed ass kids.
8:43
You ain't gonna do it no more.
8:44
I'm gonna blow your balls off now."
8:46
I'll be like, "Hold for, hold on.
8:47
Just hold on for a minute.
8:49
Fuquanda, tell her what happened."
8:50
She be like (beep) "Hum." (audience applauds)
9:03
I went to this restaurant
9:04
and I had this gay dude try to hit on me.
9:06
I tried to curse him out,
9:08
but it seemed like I kept giving him compliments.
9:11
I went up to the counter.
9:12
He was like, "Can I help you?"
9:15
I'm like, "Yeah, let me get a cheeseburger."
9:17
He like, "What you want on your cheeseburger?"
9:21
"Cheese. I want cheese on my cheeseburger."
9:23
He like, "What else?"
9:25
I'm like, "Look, you better quit playing with me, man."
9:27
He like, "Or what?"
9:28
I'm like, "Or I'll bust your ass.
9:30
I mean, no, no, no I'm not. (audience laughs and applauds)
9:40
I'm gonna do something you don't like."
9:43
Women, if you live in a bad neighborhood,
9:44
let somebody know you live in a bad neighborhood.
9:47
Have somebody drop you off, leave,
9:48
get their car shot all up, messing around
9:50
with you in your messy neighborhood, all right?
9:54
Went out with this girl one time.
9:55
She had took me to this Mexican food restaurant
9:58
that was Black owned.
10:00
I don't know how that happened.
10:03
I'm like, "Look, just wrap my food up, all right?
10:05
Look, sweetheart, I got one more joint.
10:07
We can smoke this. I'm gonna take you home.
10:09
Now where you live at?"
10:10
She's like, "Keep straight, make a right."
10:12
I pull up in front of her house.
10:14
I'm looking around like,
10:15
"Oh you live in the projects, huh?"
10:20
No, no it ain't no problem
10:21
with you living in the projects and stuff.
10:25
(audience laughs)
10:28
It's just the fact that."
10:33
Nah, these people keep walking around my car and stuff.
10:37
And I can't keep my eye on all these people
10:40
walking around my car and stuff.
10:44
I'm high, I'm paranoid.
10:46
I don't need this right now.
10:48
She tell me, "Don't worry about them.
10:50
Just walk me to my door."
10:52
I'm like, "Walk you to your door?
10:55
Bitch, you're gonna walk me back to my car."
10:58
(audience applauds)
11:09
Selfish. (audience laughs)
11:15
Men, watch who you dating out here, all right?
11:18
I had a real bad experience about two months ago.
11:22
I was in the club, kissing this man all night, man.
11:26
Nah, he looked like a woman, though.
11:27
He had that surgery.
11:28
Don't get me wrong.
11:30
This was the thickest man I ever seen in my life, all right?
11:33
Ended up buying him drinks
11:34
and holding his hand, licking his ear, and . . .
11:40
I don't even have no punchline.
11:42
Just watch who you date out here, all right?
11:45
(audience applauds)
12:17
Just did a show in Texas.
12:19
They treated me. - Woo hoo!
12:20
- Oh yeah, yeah. (audience laughs)
12:26
They treated me bad down there.
12:28
Real bad. Should have seen this hotel room they put me in.
12:31
Put me in a Mexican Super 8
12:35
called the Grande Ocho. (audience laughs)
12:40
Everything in my room was chained down.
12:43
I couldn't even pull my sheets back.
12:44
They was chained down in there.
12:49
Did a show in Alaska.
12:50
Tripped me out in Alaska.
12:52
I ain't even know there was Black people up there.
12:54
And they sleeping with everybody in Alaska.
12:57
I mean, everybody.
12:59
They got interracial couples up there all day long.
13:02
I saw Koreans with Blacks.
13:04
I saw Alaskans with Blacks.
13:06
I mean they're doing it.
13:08
I could have swore I saw a dog with big lips.
13:10
(audience laughs)
13:19
I saw this ugly lady in the airport coming down here.
13:22
I ain't want to talk about ugly people.
13:23
But as soon as I saw her, I just started frowning up.
13:28
But what was so crazy is she caught me frowning.
13:31
So I had to play it off like that's the way I always look.
13:35
Seen her, I was like, "Ew." (audience laughs)
13:40
She was like, "What?"
13:41
I like was, "Ugh." (audience laughs and applauds)
13:55
Was like, "Would you go somewhere
13:56
so I could fix my face back up, please?"
14:02
You ever see something in your closet
14:03
you ain't wore in a while?
14:04
You be like, "I ain't wore that in a minute."
14:05
Then when you put it on
14:06
and you realize why you ain't been wearing it?
14:10
That's how I feel about this shirt I got on right now.
14:13
I don't know if I left the sleeves down or not.
14:15
I'm not sure.
14:18
I'm lazy though.
14:19
I get down to my last outfit before I wash anything.
14:22
You'll see me in a club with a tuxedo on just chilling.
14:27
People like, "Where you coming from?"
14:28
I be like, "Home.
14:31
All my clothes is dirty. Do you mind, huh?"
14:37
Man, if you close to 30 years old
14:38
and you still live at home with your mother,
14:40
move on out the house.
14:42
Don't make no sense for no grown ass man
14:44
to be staying in the same room he was born in, all right?
14:48
You go in his room right now,
14:49
still got "It's A Boy" around the ceiling
14:51
and still having sex in a race car bed.
14:57
Just telling you about my life.
15:04
I'm tired of men putting big rims on any kind of car.
15:09
My friend picked me up from the airport about two weeks ago
15:11
in a Ford Focus
15:14
with 26 inch rims on it. (audience laughs)
15:19
We couldn't even turn.
15:22
We went straight for eight hours.
15:26
I was like, "Drop me off. Okay, please?"
15:33
I had another friend, he just got arrested
15:35
for making phony driver's licenses.
15:37
He was taking people regular pictures,
15:39
putting 'em on the driver's licenses.
15:41
I got my license back.
15:42
I was laying down like this on my driver's license.
15:46
He had a full body shot
15:48
of me looking in the wind on my driver's license.
15:53
Like what the hell I'm gonna do with this?
15:58
Women, when you pregnant and you having little girls,
16:00
quit giving them old names, all right?
16:03
It's a turn off when they get older.
16:06
Saw this girl in a bar last night.
16:07
21 year old. Fine, man.
16:09
I was like, "Man, you want a drink?"
16:11
She was like, "Yeah."
16:12
I was like, "Okay, what's your name?"
16:14
She was like, "Gladys."
16:17
I'm like, "Ew." (audience laughs)
16:24
I just can't imagine myself having sex with her going,
16:26
"You like this, Gladys?"
16:29
(audience laughs and applauds)
17:06
I wanna ask the white people something.
17:07
Is there anything, just holler it out, too.
17:09
Is there anything that you hate doing around Black people?
17:11
Like you can't stand for Black people to see you doing it?
17:14
Is there anything?
17:18
Huh? (audience laughs)
17:21
What'd she say? Dancing?
17:24
You hate dancing around Black people?
17:26
Yeah, we hate watching y'all dance, too.
17:29
(audience applauds)
17:37
Be like, "What is he doing over there? Goddamn."
17:42
(scattered laughter)
17:45
Anything else? Nothing else?
17:47
I had this one lady tell me-
17:49
What'd you say? - Being at the urinal.
17:51
- Being at the urinal? (audience laughs and applauds)
18:02
(audience cheers)
18:13
(Deon laughs)
18:15
I was wondering why y'all leave.
18:18
(audience laughs)
18:20
I get to the urinal, they just leave.
18:22
I be like, "Racist." (audience laughs)
18:27
(laughs) But that's why, okay.
18:32
(laughs) I gotta remember that one, yeah.
18:37
I had one lady at one of my shows,
18:39
she said she hate listening to rap music.
18:43
And I was like, "Yeah, y'all do be tough as hell
18:45
in y'all car by y'all self listening to rap music."
18:48
Y'all have rap music on in the car.
18:50
(vocalizes)
18:53
Soon as one of us pull on the side of y'all,
18:55
y'all get to picking stuff out your hair.
18:59
"Let me turn this down." (audience laughs)
19:04
I'm gonna tell you what I hate doing around white people.
19:06
I can't stand for when white people see me doing this,
19:09
I just cringe up anytime.
19:13
Working. (audience laughs and applauds)
19:21
Any kind of work, I don't even care.
19:24
I could be mopping the floor, a white guy come in,
19:25
I'd be like, "Goddamn.
19:29
I look like a colored right now.
19:33
Might as well shuck and jive.
19:35
(audience laughs and applauds)
19:40
Manny."
19:45
I hate eating chicken in front of y'all, too.
19:48
Or watermelon.
19:51
Now if I'm eating watermelon and chicken,
19:53
I want to commit suicide, I swear to you.
19:58
True story, something that happened to me.
20:01
We got this thing in Chicago called the Taste of Chicago
20:04
and we got booths from miles and miles and miles.
20:08
Just different foods you can taste
20:10
from all around the world.
20:11
And this guy gave me a handful of tickets, you know?
20:14
And they got food from all over the world
20:17
and what I'd go get?
20:18
Some chicken, right?
20:20
So I go get this chicken and I'm eating it
20:22
and there's grease popping everywhere.
20:26
I'm in my own little world.
20:28
Lips, bling blinging right now.
20:31
Just walking and eating my chicken, just, you know.
20:35
And I walk by this fruit stand
20:36
and they got seedless watermelon.
20:40
Come on, brother, seedless? (audience laughs)
20:45
You just don't see seedless all the damn time.
20:48
I'm like, "Seedless? Give me four of those."
20:55
I'm sitting there eating my chicken and watermelon,
20:58
and grease and juices combining together,
21:00
I'm humming to myself.
21:02
(mimics chewing noises)
21:07
It's this white family right on the side of me
21:08
with their camera phone like this.
21:11
(audience laughs and applauds)
21:23
"Look at him, he won't stop.
21:27
We're gonna put this on Myspace."
21:31
I'm sitting there like, "Goddamn.
21:35
Might as well shuck and jive." (audience laughs)
21:38
Hey, I'm Deon Cole.
21:39
Thanks a lot, Comedy Central.
