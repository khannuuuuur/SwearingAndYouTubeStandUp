I'm loopy 'cause I had a really weird morning.
0:04
I looked at myself in the mirror,
0:07
and I know you guys are like, "We all look at ourselves,"
0:10
but when's the last time you really, really
0:12
actually looked at yourself, you know what I mean?
0:14
'Cause we all do the thing in the morning
0:16
where we like get up, we get ready,
0:18
we look in the mirror and we go, "Okay, no blood,"
0:20
then we just go out into the world, you know?
0:23
But I did that thing this morning
0:25
where I like stared into my soul,
0:27
you know what I mean.
0:29
So I noticed like the shape of my eyebrows
0:31
and like how round my nose is
0:33
and what my cheeks look like and I was just like,
0:36
"Oh, my God!
0:40
"I'm...
0:41
gorgeous!"
0:43
I had no idea!
0:47
This whole time,
0:49
I thought I was a seven.
0:51
Turns out I'm a nine
0:53
before I put these chains on!
0:58
Such is life. God is good.
1:03
But then, like, my second immediate thought
1:06
was just like, wait a second.
1:07
I actually hate the way I look.
1:09
And that sucks too. Being skinny sucks
1:12
because muscular dudes ruin sleeveless shirts
1:15
for guys who look like me. Know what I'm sayin'?
1:18
'Cause if a muscular dude puts on a sleeveless shirt,
1:20
it's to let you know if something's going down,
1:22
he's got it, you know what I'm sayin'?
1:25
And it's nice. If a muscular dude
1:27
walked in here right now wearing a sleeveless shirt,
1:29
we'd be like...whew!
1:31
I do not have to be the hero today!
1:34
Todd's got it. You know?
1:39
But it's a bummer, you know, 'cause it's like
1:41
I like to wear sleeveless shirts too,
1:43
and it's to show people, like, yo,
1:46
you don't have to worry about me.
1:48
You know what I'm saying? Like, I am not a threat
1:50
at all, right?
1:53
Like, these arms, they're for drawing,
1:55
origami,
1:58
making desserts. That's it!
2:03
I'm not hurting anybody.
2:04
I'm not defending anybody's honor.
2:06
Say what you want about my mom.
2:09
She's an adult. She'll handle it.
2:11
You know what I mean? I'm not...[laughs]
2:15
not getting in the middle of grown folks' business.
2:17
That's just not me. I'll step back and be like,
2:19
"You guys hash it out. I'm gonna be in the car."
2:22
I, uh, I been skinny my whole life.
2:25
I was so skinny, I remember, I was so skinny
2:28
that when I got to high school it was just like...
2:31
like if someone wants to fight me,
2:33
like my only option is to die.
2:37
What am I gonna do--
2:39
What am I gonna do to defend myself
2:41
if someone wants to, like, do battle?
2:43
Like, I don't know. I can't do anything.
2:45
So I'm just gonna join a gang, and they'll help me out.
2:48
So that's what I did.
2:49
So sophomore year of high school, y'all,
2:52
I joined the Crips and they made me treasurer.
2:56
Can you believe that? Crip Treasurer!
2:59
Real job!
3:01
All right, you guys, thank you so much.
