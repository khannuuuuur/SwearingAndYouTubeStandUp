MAN 2: Copy that.

WOMAN: Talent's on the move.

MAN 3: Hey, have your tickets out.

MAN 4: Stage is ready.

EMCEE: What's going on, Boston?
0:17
(audience cheering)
0:18
Tonight is the night!
0:20
Welcome to Comedy Central's The Half Hour.
0:23
(cheering)
0:27
Ladies and gentlemen,
0:28
put your hands together for Joe List!
0:30
(cheering)
0:40
Boy, thanks.
0:43
Thanks, everybody.
0:45
That was really nice.
0:47
This is exciting, huh?
0:48
(scattered cheers)
0:51
No? All right, well...
0:52
(laughter)
0:54
Biggest night of my life.
0:55
You guys really stiffed me there, uh...
0:58
I'm excited.
0:59
I'm trying to look cool. Do I look cool?
1:00
I don't know. It's hard to tell.
1:02
Do you ever go to put your foot up on something to look cool
1:03
and then you realize it's a much higher surface
1:06
than you originally thought it was?
1:09
I was at a bar today talking to a girl.
1:11
I'm like, "Yeah, I do comedy.
1:12
It's pretty sweet."
1:16
Well, that looked a lot lower when I started this.
1:20
You can't panic. You got to go with it.
1:21
I'm like, "I thought you might want
1:22
to see my testicles through my jeans."
1:24
(laughter)
1:26
Your knee should never be higher
1:28
than your genitals in a conversation.
1:29
That's a good rule of thumb... generally.
1:33
I have horrible anxiety. I'm nervous right now.
1:35
I have a panic disorder, panic attacks.
1:37
I don't know if you guys ever had one of those.
1:38
They're pretty brutal.
1:39
Oh, someone tried clapping-- appreciate it.
1:41
I usually boo... panic attacks.
1:44
If you've never had a panic attack,
1:46
it's almost like you're being attacked by panic.
1:47
That's how I would sort of describe it.
1:50
I'm not a doctor, but, uh...
1:52
If you've never had one, you might not sympathize.
1:55
It's hard to get sympathy from people that haven't had one.
1:58
I was talking to my best friend.
1:59
He's like, "Panic attack-- what's that?
2:00
You feel like you're gonna die-- is that it?"
2:03
Uh, yep.
2:06
That's it.
2:07
I just feel like I'm going to die.
2:12
I don't know if you know this,
2:13
but feeling like you're gonna die
2:14
is very similar to dying,
2:16
except at the end, instead of dead,
2:17
you're sad and embarrassed.
2:18
It's...
2:20
it's actually worse.
2:22
(applause)
2:23
He's like, "Yeah, but it can't do
2:25
any permanent damage, can it?"
2:26
I'm like, "No, but crying in the fetal position
2:29
on a first date can screw you up for a few years."
2:31
So it's sort of a sliding scale, I guess.
2:35
I had to go to a therapist,
2:37
'cause I kept having panic attacks.
2:39
The, uh, therapist told me a panic attack
2:40
is fight or flight phenomenon.
2:42
I don't know if you know that term.
2:43
That's when your brain prepares your body
2:44
to fight or flee from whatever it's afraid of.
2:47
She said it happens in nature.
2:49
I'm like, "That's cool."
2:50
The only weird thing is, I get panic attacks
2:52
when I'm talking to girls,
2:53
so that's sort of a weird situation.
2:55
I'll be at a bar after the show and some girl's like,
2:57
"You were really funny tonight."
2:59
And I'm like, "I'm gonna have to fight this bitch."
3:01
(laughter)
3:02
(applause)
3:08
I can't run away!
3:09
That would be embarrassing.
3:11
I'm like, "Put 'em up, young lady!
3:12
I don't appreciate this."
3:15
I was trying to relax more. It's hard.
3:17
I started doing yoga. Yoga helps my anxiety.
3:19
Uh, yoga helps my anxiety after I'm done with it.
3:21
After yoga, I feel good.
3:23
During yoga, that's the most anxiety that I've ever had
3:26
in my entire life.
3:28
If you're not familiar with yoga, it's usually me,
3:30
two gay guys and 25 of the hottest women
3:33
that I've ever seen in my entire life.
3:35
I can't be publically horny, homophobic
3:38
and relaxed all at the same time.
3:41
It's...
3:44
That's a lot of work, you know?
3:47
Instructor's like, "Everyone put your legs over your heads."
3:49
I'm like, "Oh, my God, I was just gonna say that."
3:51
That is a great idea.
3:54
Let's get those legs up, ladies.
3:56
Oh, me, too?
3:58
Oh, I'm sorry. I was gonna watch this one.
4:01
And then she's like, "Everyone lay down on your tummy."
4:03
I'm like, "I can't.
4:04
I have the largest erection of my entire life."
4:08
I'm going to teeter-totter from shoulder to shoulder
4:10
if I'm laying on my tummy.
4:16
I also have a small "namastain" in my shorts here.
4:19
Uh...
4:21
(laughter, applause)
4:23
Thank you.
4:24
"Namaste" is a yoga term.
4:25
"Namastain" is a semen joke I wrote.
4:27
I added one letter to the previous thing.
4:32
It's hard to relax. I was, um,
4:34
I've been going to the gym lately.
4:36
My gym has a steam room in it.
4:37
My buddy's like, "You should go take a steam.
4:38
Steam rooms are really relaxing."
4:40
I don't know if you guys have ever done that before.
4:42
A steam room is relaxing if you are
4:44
the only person in the steam room.
4:46
That's relaxing.
4:47
Then you hear that door swing open
4:49
and you realize that somebody else has entered the steam room,
4:51
but you can't see them because it's too steamy.
4:55
That's no longer a relaxing situation, you know?
4:59
Now you're in some sort of weird ghost porn
5:02
where you're sharing a tiny hot space
5:05
with an elderly naked man that you can't see
5:08
until he's a penis distance away from your face.
5:10
(laughter)
5:13
I'm like, "I was relaxed, but now I realize
5:15
"I'm laying in a puddle of ringworm
5:16
and a spirit dick has arrived in front of my eyes."
5:19
(applause)
5:23
I'm trying to let the guy know where I'm at,
5:25
but it sounds like flirting.
5:27
I'm like, "I'm over here.
5:29
I'm right over here, sir, and..."
5:31
I'm like, "That sounds too weird."
5:32
I'm like, "Just make a noise."
5:33
So I'm like... (growls)
5:36
(meows)
5:37
(imitates explosion)
5:41
(woman laughing)
5:43
Thank you.
5:44
A little bit later than everybody,
5:45
but I'll take it, uh...
5:48
Last year I went to Aruba.
5:49
I was trying to, uh, relax a little bit,
5:50
so I went down to Aruba.
5:51
I thought that would be relaxing.
5:52
But I booked the early flight for my vacation.
5:54
You ever book the early flight for your vacation?
5:55
Then you get there before your hotel room is ready.
5:57
That's not relaxing. I got there at noon.
5:59
I'm like, "I'd like to check in."
6:01
They're like, "You can check in, but your room is not ready yet."
6:03
I was like, "So, I can not check in?"
6:06
She's like, "No, you can check in.
6:08
You just can't have a room."
6:10
I think we have different understandings
6:12
of what "checking in" means.
6:15
Without a room, I'm just checking in with you personally.
6:17
I don't really care about you-- no offense.
6:19
I don't want to get in a big fight, though,
6:22
'cause I was trying to relax. I was like, "You know what?
6:24
"Don't even worry about it. I'll just go take a nice,
6:25
"relaxing walk on the beach
6:27
in my jeans and North Face jacket."
6:30
'Cause I flew to Aruba from New York City in February.
6:33
Is there a more psychotic look
6:35
than walking up a white, sandy beach
6:37
dragging luggage behind you?
6:38
I'm like...
6:40
Sorry about your sand castle.
6:42
I'm an idiot.
6:43
I booked the early flight.
6:44
Gonna get this sand out of my wool socks.
6:47
Uh...
6:51
My friend told me I should
6:52
meditate to relax, and that's always weird.
6:54
First of all, you ever try to read a book
6:56
and the opening quote before the book even starts
6:58
is too much for you to understand?
7:02
My friend told me I should meditate,
7:04
so I went to the bookstore, I picked up the meditation book.
7:06
Page one, it said, "Only that day dawns
7:09
to which you are awake."
7:13
I was like... (exhales)
7:16
Well, this book is for somebody else.
7:18
I'm...
7:20
I'm having a panic attack
7:22
trying to break down the first sentence
7:23
in this book.
7:25
Evidently I'm too dumb to meditate.
7:27
I didn't know that was possible.
7:29
My friend's like, "You have anxiety? You should meditate."
7:31
Oh, I should sit alone
7:33
in a room with nothing but my thoughts?
7:37
That's a cure for anxiety?
7:39
What's your cure for my ADD, Sudoku?
7:42
I don't really...
7:46
He goes, "Meditation's easy.
7:48
You just lay still with your eyes closed for, like, an hour."
7:50
I'm like, "Isn't that a nap?
7:53
That seems awfully similar to a nap to me."
7:55
He's like, "No, it's different.
7:57
You let your mind wander wherever it goes."
7:59
I'm like, "Yeah, that's a dream.
8:01
"That is a nap featuring a dream
8:03
"that you're referring to.
8:04
"Been doing that since I was a fetus.
8:06
It doesn't help with my anxiety."
8:09
So now I just take naps
8:12
and then I tell people I meditated.
8:13
You can do that.
8:14
That's not against the rules.
8:16
Nobody checks.
8:17
It's nice.
8:19
If you tell people you nap, they think that you're lazy.
8:21
If you tell people you meditate,
8:22
they think that you're better than them.
8:23
It's kind of nice, you know?
8:26
I also replace the term "masturbate"
8:28
with the term "my stretches."
8:30
That's another thing that you guys can do.
8:32
Yeah.
8:36
If you kind of... if you combine those two,
8:37
it makes it seem like you're a lot healthier
8:39
than you actually are, you know?
8:41
I talk to my mother, she's like, "What'd you do today, Joe?
8:43
I'm like, "I woke up pretty early.
8:44
Did my stretches, got the blood flowing."
8:49
"Then I ate a light breakfast,
8:51
then I meditated for about two and a half hours, so..."
8:56
"Then I woke up, stretched again,
8:57
"meditated for another half an hour.
8:59
It was a big day."
9:02
She's like, "I'm really proud of you.
9:03
That takes a lot of discipline."
9:04
I'm like, "It sure does.
9:06
Only that day dawns to which you are awake, so..."
9:10
Remember that. Yeah.
9:12
(man whoops) Oh, thank you.
9:14
Thank you!
9:16
I had to quit drinking,
9:18
'cause that was giving me too much anxiety and...
9:21
I should be more clear.
9:22
I had to quit drinking 'cause I was an alcoholic
9:23
and that was giving me anxiety, 'cause...
9:25
You gotta be clear on that,
9:26
'cause otherwise, it's confusing to people.
9:28
People are like, "Drinking helps anxiety."
9:29
I'm like, "Well, probably
9:30
we drank differently than each other, you know."
9:32
Some people will drink and unwind.
9:34
I would unravel. There's a difference, you know?
9:36
Some people are like,
9:37
"I have a glass of wine and put my feet up."
9:39
I'm like, "I like a bottle of Jägermeister.
9:41
"Take my pants off and throw them at somebody.
9:42
That's how I like to do it."
9:46
Waking up covered in bruises
9:47
and street signs--
9:49
not as relaxing as you might think it would be, you know?
9:52
I'm like, "This might be a sign that it's time to stop."
9:55
My friend's like, "What is?"
9:56
I'm like, "This stop sign.
9:59
"It's a literal sign to stop.
10:01
It's covered in my blood and in my bed, so..."
10:10
When I was kid, my family used to use the word "happy"
10:11
to describe "drunk."
10:13
Instead of, like, "shit-faced" or "hammered."
10:15
They'd all be like,
10:16
"We were getting pretty happy last night."
10:18
That'll sort of plant the seeds of alcoholism in you.
10:22
When you're nine years old
10:24
and you think "happy" means "drunk," you know?
10:26
I'm in third grade.
10:28
My teacher's like, "What makes you happy, Joe?"
10:29
And I'm like, "Well, I'm actually not old enough
10:31
"to be happy just yet, but...
10:33
I'm hoping eventually I'll live happily ever after."
10:35
Uh...
10:38
Yeah.
10:39
Horrible anxiety all the time.
10:42
I was in, uh, New York recent--
10:43
I live in New York, and, um, I was there and...
10:45
I was at a Burger King and, uh...
10:47
Let me ask you guys this,
10:49
and, uh, you don't have to answer, it's a TV taping,
10:50
but let me ask you this.
10:52
Are you guys familiar with the credit card swipe
10:53
that, uh, white, heterosexual males do to each other?
10:56
Have you ever heard of this?
10:57
MAN: Yes! A couple people.
10:59
One-one fella. All right.
11:00
If you're not familiar--
11:02
or maybe you're just... maybe you just don't want to admit it,
11:04
you're on a date or whatever-- it's a thing...
11:06
you make a blade with your hand
11:07
and then you rub it between a friend's butt cheeks
11:09
and then you go, "Credit card!"
11:12
You guys ever... hear of that?
11:14
One guy. Thank you, buddy.
11:16
Some people say "Credit or debit?"
11:17
It depends on...
11:19
I didn't invent this.
11:20
I just live in a world where it exists. Uh...
11:23
I don't know what they're purchasing
11:25
with the credit card swipe.
11:27
I believe it's closeted homosexuality,
11:28
but I can't be sure.
11:32
Anyways, that's a thing that happens, and, uh,
11:34
I was at a Burger King in New York
11:35
and I was kind of standing in line by myself,
11:36
I was checking out the menu or whatever,
11:38
and, uh, a buddy of mine,
11:39
he came in and he recognized me from behind--
11:41
not in, like, a sexual way, he saw that it was me--
11:43
and, uh, he did the credit...
11:46
he credit card swiped me.
11:48
And I just jumped. I was like, "Dah!"
11:50
And I... I'm tougher than I look, everybody.
11:51
I turned and I kind of had him by the shirt with my...
11:53
I was like, "What the...?"
11:54
And my buddy was like, "Dude, it's me."
11:57
And I was like, "Oh, hey, Dan."
12:00
And he goes, "Dude, you are crazy."
12:05
And I was like, "Am I? Crazy?"
12:08
Because it seems to me
12:10
that I'm alone at a Burger King in New York City
12:13
and I felt a hand in my ass.
12:17
And I thought, I'm gonna turn
12:19
and punch the person whose hand is in my ass.
12:22
That doesn't seem all that crazy to me.
12:26
Tell you what does seem crazy:
12:28
using fingers in the butt as a salutation.
12:32
That seems crazy.
12:34
Thanks.
12:40
A lot of folks are doing the shoulder tap
12:41
and/or the name of the person.
12:43
Both very popular ways to get attention.
12:46
I would've settled for that knee buckle.
12:48
When people kick your knee out? You know that move? When...
12:51
Pretty much any situation
12:53
where someone puts their fingers in my rear end,
12:54
I'm going to turn and punch them.
12:57
Unless it's during sex, in which case I will say,
12:59
"No, thank you, but...
13:01
"I appreciate the effort.
13:03
"Like where your head's at,
13:05
"just don't like where your fingers are at.
13:07
You know? It's, uh..."
13:09
A lot of beautiful girls here tonight. That's exciting.
13:11
I don't know. Can you tell girls they're beautiful?
13:12
I don't even know anymore.
13:13
One... one's clapping. Um...
13:14
Oh, that was a guy, I think, that clapped.
13:16
(audience laughs)
13:17
Trying to get laid back there, and, uh...
13:19
me, too.
13:21
(inhales)
13:23
Can you tell girls they're pretty?
13:24
I don't even know anymore.
13:25
I told a girl she was pretty the other day, she got mad at me.
13:26
She was like, "I don't need you to validate me."
13:30
Yikes.
13:31
Was just trying to be nice.
13:33
I... didn't mean to imply
13:35
that you're a mall parking garage ticket.
13:36
Uh...
13:40
It's like, if it makes you feel any better,
13:41
I only think you're pretty on the outside now.
13:44
Um...
13:50
You seem like a very unpleasant human being to me, so...
13:54
It's hard to compliment girls.
13:55
I check girls out, though. We all do that, right, you guys?
13:57
Check out girls, girls check out guys.
13:59
it's only natural, right?
14:00
You ever get caught checking out a girl with your girlfriend?
14:02
Not because she sees you, but because you elbow her,
14:04
thinking she's one of your buddies?
14:06
That's a...
14:08
The other day my girlfriend and I are in the park.
14:11
I'm like, "Hey, check out this...
14:13
ugly bitch over here!"
14:17
"I hate that woman!"
14:20
Thought you were Phil.
14:22
Sorry about that, uh...
14:24
I just don't like the, the rough stuff.
14:25
One... I think I'm scarred.
14:27
One time I had sex with a woman, and, uh, she was, like, very...
14:29
I was single and drinking at the time.
14:30
She was very aggressive, this girl.
14:31
It was, like, a one-night stand.
14:33
She, like, threw me down on the bed,
14:34
which I was kind of into and...
14:35
but then she got on top and, uh,
14:36
we started to make love or whatever,
14:38
and it got really aggressive.
14:40
She just started bouncing wildly.
14:41
No rhythm; just like a herky-jerky...
14:43
(laughter)
14:45
It was like she was riding a bike with a flat tire.
14:47
I was like...
14:49
I was like, "Just pick up the bike and run with it!"
14:51
Then it got more aggressive.
14:54
She started shoving my shoulders
14:55
into the bed really hard.
14:57
And then she started calling me a nerd.
14:59
She was like, "Yeah, you nerd!
15:02
You like that, you nerd?!"
15:04
I was like, "I don't like that!
15:07
"You're hurting my shoulders.
15:08
"And my feelings, also!
15:10
"Also, I'm not really a nerd.
15:14
"I just have bad eyesight.
15:15
"You're being very judgmental, all right?
15:17
"I understand I'm wearing glasses,
15:18
"but I'm a very good athlete
15:19
and-and I'm bad at math and I hate sci-fi."
15:23
Also, I'm getting laid right now.
15:24
That's not very nerdy, is it?
15:27
It's pretty cool if you ask me.
15:29
(cheering)
15:30
Yeah, thank you.
15:35
Then she was like, "Shut up, you bitch!"
15:37
She started choking me.
15:38
It's true.
15:41
If you're into choking, that's cool.
15:42
I'm not here to judge.
15:44
But you can't choke the first time you have sex with somebody.
15:47
I don't... You might be murdering me.
15:48
I have no idea who you are.
15:51
We didn't go over a safe word, so I just started guessing.
15:54
I was like, "Chocolate chips, Advil... pennies.
15:57
Please get off of me."
16:04
I guess that was her fetish was to have sex with a nerd.
16:06
But she didn't run it by me beforehand, you know?
16:09
In order for fetish sex to take place,
16:11
both parties have to sign off on it, you know?
16:13
Like, I like high heels during sex.
16:14
But if the girl's not into it, I won't put them on.
16:16
You know what I mean? It's, uh...
16:18
I... That's just for the kids, that one.
16:20
That's a nice, silly, very silly...
16:23
Yeah.
16:25
Recently, my girlfriend and I, we were on vacation.
16:27
We were in, uh, Vermont.
16:29
We were about to, uh, make love at a hotel.
16:30
And right before we started to have sex,
16:32
she was like, "Wait, I just got creeped out."
16:35
And that's not a sentence you ever want to hear
16:37
right before sex.
16:38
I was like, "Why are you creeped out?"
16:40
She was like, "Could you check under the bed
16:41
to make sure that nobody's under there?"
16:44
And I was like, "Well, you have just come up
16:46
"with the most efficient way to get rid of an erection
16:48
of all time."
16:51
Because I am now terrified and have no interest in having sex.
16:54
I was like, "What am I supposed to do
16:57
if someone's under the bed?"
17:00
She was like, "Protect me!"
17:02
And I was like, "I'll put on a condom if you want protection,
17:04
but... I don't know what to do with this guy under the bed."
17:08
How is that conversation supposed to go?
17:10
I'm naked and never been in one fight ever
17:12
in my entire life.
17:14
I'm just gonna bounce
17:15
a Hitchcock character out of our hotel room?
17:18
Like, I'm leaning under there.
17:20
"Oh, my God, there's somebody under there, honey.
17:21
"You nailed it.
17:22
"Come on out of there, you son of a gun.
17:25
We've had it up to here with your shenanigans."
17:29
I have a niece. She's a little baby.
17:30
The other day I was at my sister's house.
17:31
My niece was taking a nap down the hallway.
17:33
We're all in the living room having fun; we're a fun family.
17:35
I get up, I'm like, "I'm gonna grab another drink.
17:36
Does anybody need anything?"
17:37
My sister goes, "Hey, while you're up,
17:38
could you check on the baby?"
17:40
And I was like, "I don't even know what that means."
17:42
She goes, "You know what I mean.
17:43
"Just go down there and make sure she's
17:45
still breathing and hasn't rolled out of bed."
17:47
I was like, "Wait a minute, there's a chance that your baby
17:49
is dead down the hallway?"
17:53
That's your parental system--
17:55
periodically dispatch a relative
17:57
to see if some... the baby has passed away?
18:01
I was like, "Would one of you guys mind checking on the baby?
18:04
"'Cause I'm not sure how to come back here
18:05
with possibly the worst news ever."
18:11
I'm gonna have to walk back into a party with a fresh drink.
18:13
"Hey."
18:17
"Just checked on the baby. Uh...
18:20
may want to sit down for this. It's pretty serious."
18:24
Uh...
18:26
If you have kids, get a babysitter. Pay your babysitter.
18:29
That's my advice. Pay your babysitter.
18:30
My parents tried to save money by going with a free babysitter,
18:33
which is sort of a weird place to save money, uh...
18:38
child care. Uh...
18:41
My mother had her kid brother, my Uncle Dale, babysit me.
18:43
Uh, great guy, not sure if you know him. Uh...
18:46
First of all, he was, like, three years older than me.
18:48
Not a good age difference, you know?
18:51
Good rule of thumb: you should be able to tell
18:52
who the babysitter is by looking at the two people involved.
18:55
My uncle showed me Nightmare on Elm Street.
18:57
Uh, I was seven. I immediately pissed in my pants.
19:02
I was like, "I'm gonna go to the bathroom." He's like,
19:03
"I'll pause it." I was like, "Please don't.
19:04
Fast-forward it. I hate this movie."
19:06
I tried to dry the urine off my pants, but I used toilet paper,
19:10
which doesn't work. It just disintegrates.
19:12
It looks like somebody threw confetti at your wet groin.
19:17
Then I came out of the bathroom.
19:18
This is where it gets really fun.
19:19
My uncle was a fun guy,
19:20
just a fun, fun person.
19:22
He turned every light in the house off so it was pitch-black.
19:25
Then he took an aerosol air freshener and a lighter
19:28
and he shot a fireball down the hallway.
19:32
Classic babysitting gag.
19:37
The old "shoot fire at the child you're responsible for."
19:42
Whew, it's fun.
19:45
That first time, it's a little nerve-racking
19:46
when you first see it, you know?
19:48
I had to act like it was fun 'cause I was afraid of him.
19:49
I was like, "Good one, Uncle Dale. You almost got me."
19:51
You almost got me handicapped parking for the rest of my life
19:55
by burning my seven-year-old face off.
19:59
Luckily, it dried some of the urine off my pants.
20:01
That was kind of a nice feature.
20:03
My mother came home. She's like,
20:05
"Why do you smell like urine and have a sunburn?"
20:06
I'm like, "'Cause your brother's a psychopath. That's why."
20:10
You guys are great. Thank you very much!
20:12
Thanks a lot!
20:13
My name is Joe!
20:15
Thank you!
