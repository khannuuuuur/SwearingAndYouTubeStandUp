- Been thinking about vision boarding.
0:03
(audience laughing)
0:04
That's funny? Okay.
0:07
I thought I was gonna be vulnerable with y'all,
0:09
but I'll hold it back.
0:11
No, I wanted a vision board, right?
0:13
But I just don't know how long
0:14
you have to complete the visions.
0:17
(audience laughing)
0:18
Like I've heard everything
0:19
from like a week to like 'till you die.
0:22
I'm like, those are supposed to be
0:25
two different things, right?
0:27
(audience laughing)
0:29
I had no idea.
0:30
I just put mad obtainable shit on there.
0:31
I was more, that shit turned into
0:32
a grocery list, if anything.
0:35
(audience laughing)
0:35
Like I've got Nike socks.
0:38
Remember to get deodorant.
0:40
(audience laughing)
0:41
Maybe get a sandwich named after me at the delis.
0:44
Something to strive for, you know what I'm saying?
0:48
Really put in that work.
0:50
I did get a letter the other day from the IRS.
0:54
Yeah, well I got it like last year.
0:56
I just opened it up the other day.
0:58
(audience laughing)
1:00
I did. I threw that shit right in the garbage.
1:03
'Cause like I tried to open it, right?
1:06
And then I got a paper cut and I was like, you know what?
1:09
This was not on the vision board, right?
1:11
(audience laughing)
1:12
Distracting me, taking me off course.
1:15
I was like, we gotta do better.
1:20
Oh, I started thinking about ass eating
1:24
and what's the most masculine way
1:28
to get that done, right?
1:29
I was like, I'm glad that's on all of our minds.
1:33
(audience laughing)
1:35
But it was particular, I was like
1:36
what's the most masculine way to get this done?
1:38
I had to rule out some options, right?
1:40
I was like, probably not on my stomach
1:43
or my back, 'cause then I'd have to
1:44
like check back or lift both my legs up.
1:50
I was like, I don't want to do that.
1:52
But I think I figured it out right?
1:54
I think the best way to do it
1:55
is probably just to squat over somebody.
1:57
You just get like one of these, right?
2:00
And you just sit in it, right?
2:02
(audience laughing)
2:03
It's okay that we eye level, right?
2:04
Be mature.
2:06
Nah, you want to just sit in it, right?
2:07
And then what you want to do
2:09
is you wanna fold your arms, right?
2:11
'Cause you don't wanna look like you enjoying yourself.
2:13
That's important. (audience laughing)
2:15
You sit in there, you let it happen, right?
2:18
You go through all of it, right?
2:19
And then right before it starts to feel good
2:21
you just be like, that's enough, right?
2:25
You don't deserve it.
2:27
(audience laughing)
2:29
That's the masculine way.
2:30
You go through it, you get up,
2:32
you schedule another one, right?
2:33
You keep it blue card.
2:40
Honestly, I think I got my IG,
2:43
like my discovery in a healthy spot.
2:44
It's just butt cheeks and brisket, right?
2:47
(audience laughing)
2:48
Thank you, thank you, thank you.
2:52
That shit was not always like that.
2:53
It was a darker time.
2:54
Like before, it was like restoration reels
2:57
of like black head removal.
2:59
I was like all right, I gotta start doing the hard work.
3:02
Had to get in there, really fuck up the algorithm.
3:05
(audience laughing) Liking it, liking it,
3:07
liking it, scrolling, liking it
3:09
sending it to homies, saving it, right?
3:11
You gotta do the work.
3:14
Now it's just butt cheeks and brisket all day.
3:17
All day.
3:18
You ever like, you ever looking at something
3:21
and catch yourself smiling at it?
3:22
Like, oh.
3:24
(audience laughing)
3:26
I'm like that's nice.
3:29
I'm like, that's so crazy,
3:30
how am I supposed to eat this?
3:33
(audience laughing)
3:38
I was looking online the other day seeing how much
3:40
those, 'I voted early' stickers were.
3:44
They, (audience laughing)
3:47
they kind of expensive.
3:48
They like $5 plus like $15 shipping.
3:52
I was like let's re-plan.
3:57
I was like, what are my options?
3:59
Them shits are like, those stickers they like clout, bro.
4:01
You have a sticker on, people see you, right?
4:04
And they be like, Oh, shit
4:05
you voted early, you so tapped in, right?
4:08
And then you just be like,
4:10
just doing my civic duty or whatever.
4:13
(audience laughing)
4:14
Just doing my part.
4:19
They'd be like, Wow, that's crazy.
4:20
That's mad sexy, who'd you vote for?
4:22
You'd be like, That's none of your damn business.
4:24
(audience cheering)
4:27
They be like, Wow you mad mysterious,
4:32
some shit. (audience laughing)
4:35
Check.
4:40
Just walking around my neighborhood the other day.
4:43
Made eye contact with this lady.
4:45
She was an older white lady.
4:47
Nobody's fault, just the situation.
4:49
(audience laughing)
4:51
Just the situation I came across.
4:53
So I was mature about it.
4:56
I was like, I've seen this on TV, I know how to act, right?
4:59
(audience laughing)
5:00
I smile just to say what up.
5:03
But in return, this lady grabbed her purse.
5:07
I was insulted.
5:08
I asked, I was like, Miss, why'd you grab your purse?
5:09
'Cause I'm black?
5:11
She got fake offended.
5:12
She was like, No, no, no, no, I love black people.
5:14
Beyonce is my spirit animal.
5:18
She was like, If anything I hate gingers.
5:21
(audience laughing)
5:24
I was like, I get that, that makes sense, right?
5:28
But then I thought about it, right?
5:29
You rearrange the letters in ginger...
5:33
(audience realizing)
5:35
It spells nigger.
5:38
So I stole her purse anyway, right?
5:43
I was like, lesson's gotta get learned.
5:44
Just doin' my part.
5:46
(audience cheering)
5:48
Like she was very convinced and she almost had me.
5:50
I was like, Ahaha, oh, give me your purse.
5:53
(audience laughing)
5:55
That was good.
6:03
You guys ever been so broke you could pass a drug test?
6:06
(audience laughing)
6:13
I can't tell if you was laughing with or at me bro.
6:16
He was clapping bent over.
6:18
I was like, okay.
6:21
Luckily I've been reading my anti-bullying books.
6:23
I ain't gonna let that get to me.
6:25
(audience laughing)
6:28
I don't even apply to jobs that drug test.
6:29
It's like a professional courtesy to myself.
6:31
(audience laughing)
6:32
It's like, they'll find out.
6:35
I'll be at the interview, they quick, they on it.
6:37
They be like, what's that smell?
6:39
I'm like, I'm not available nights or weekends.
6:41
(audience laughing)
6:44
Like, put me on your payroll please.
6:46
Thank you.
6:51
You ever walk out of a McDonald's
6:53
and then two blocks later you see another McDonald's
6:56
and you're just like fuck it, round two?
7:01
I already know what I want, this is perfect.
7:05
Sometimes I just circle the block,
7:06
walk in the same McDonald's, acting surprised.
7:10
(audience laughing)
7:11
Just walk in there like oh shit.
7:14
(audience laughing)
7:15
What up Terry? First time seeing you today.
7:17
Shut the fuck up.
7:20
Terry don't even work there, he just bathes there.
7:22
It's like, bro, you got other
7:24
(audience laughing) things you need to focus on.
7:28
We got beef too.
7:29
'Cause we both like to collect the fast food receipts.
7:31
I don't know, I'm not sure why he's doing it,
7:33
but I like to do it because on a rainy day,
7:36
I could just fill out all those
7:37
online surveys, just eat like a champ.
7:41
Super, it's super easy.
7:44
You, I do it right on my phone.
7:45
They be like, How was our service?
7:47
Terrible.
7:49
Here's a free burger.
7:50
I'll be back.
7:52
(audience laughing)
7:53
I was like, damn y'all good.
7:58
You know there's a secret menu at McDonald's?
8:01
I only know one item, it's called the mcgangbang.
8:03
You heard of that one? (audience laughing)
8:05
That one, that shit's insane, that.
8:07
Just to be clear, it's a sandwich.
8:09
I don't want y'all Googling the wrong thing.
8:11
(audience laughing)
8:12
Being like, he said.
8:16
(audience laughing) What it is, right,
8:17
they take a McDouble, right?
8:18
They separate it, put a full
8:19
McChicken sandwich right in the middle.
8:21
It's like a Russian doll experience, right?
8:23
Very cultured, right?
8:25
(audience laughing)
8:28
I will say this, if you order it,
8:29
you gotta go in confident.
8:30
You can't go in there halfassin' it,
8:32
unsure of yourself, right?
8:34
Like you gotta go in there strong.
8:35
Don't walk in there bein' like,
8:36
Yo, y'all got mcgangbangs or whatever?
8:39
They gonna be like, No, get the fuck outta here.
8:41
This is a Christian owned family operation, bro.
8:47
We owned by Disney. Get outta here.
8:50
(audience laughing)
8:51
You just gotta go in there confident,
8:52
be like Yo, let me get a mcgangbang,
8:54
or whatever, right?
8:57
And they gonna look at you and be like, What?
8:59
But that's just a test.
9:00
You just gotta pass.
9:02
You gotta pass that moment.
9:03
Keep your head up.
9:04
They be like, What?
9:05
You just look at them, be like, you heard me.
9:08
(audience laughing)
9:10
And then they gonna be like,
9:11
Fuck, all right man, I got you, right?
9:13
And they gotta give you that sandwich.
9:16
(audience laughing)
9:17
Don't be a coward,
9:18
don't order separately and try to make it.
9:19
You gotta order it together, right?
9:22
Dope thing about it also, the receipt,
9:23
also works as a doctor's note.
9:25
You don't even gotta go back to work after that.
9:27
(audience laughing)
9:29
It's got instructions right on the back.
9:30
It's like, go home, elevate your feet,
9:33
don't close your eyes for like two days.
9:35
(audience laughing)
9:38
I did see a dick pic at work.
9:40
(audience cheering)
9:41
Was that relatable?
9:43
(audience laughing) Nah?
9:45
I would've called it sexual harassment,
9:47
but he did ask me first.
9:48
I was like, That's profess, right?
9:51
(audience laughing)
9:52
It happened fast.
9:54
He was like, Bro, you trying to see a picture of my dick?
9:55
And before I could say no, I said yes.
9:58
(audience laughing)
10:00
I was like, every time I do it to myself.
10:03
He pulled it up on his phone.
10:04
I took it out of his hand, right?
10:05
I was like, that's how I get a better look.
10:07
I'm trying to become the best wing man I can be, right?
10:10
(audience laughing)
10:11
Get all the information.
10:12
Some of y'all pulling back, it's okay.
10:14
(audience laughing)
10:15
'Cause there's logic behind this, right?
10:16
Like, like if we're out at a bar
10:18
he's talking to a girl, having a tough time.
10:20
I can always just cut in, be like,
10:22
Excuse me miss, my boy got a big dick.
10:25
(audience laughing)
10:28
Trust me.
10:30
(audience cheering)
10:31
And she'll probably be like,
10:32
Sir you got kind eyes and a soulful voice.
10:34
Thank you for the heads up.
10:36
That really cut my time in half.
10:39
But, in reality, when he showed me the pic,
10:41
he was like, Napoleon, I showed you one of mines.
10:43
Now you gotta show me one of yours.
10:46
I was like, that's fair, right?
10:48
(audience laughing)
10:49
So like, later on I'm watching food videos in my phone.
10:52
I got an erection, I was like, perfect, right?
10:54
I'm gonna knock this out
10:55
right now. (audience laughing)
10:57
Took the picture.
10:58
It was beautiful.
10:59
It was black and white, avant garde.
11:00
Really French film like.
11:01
(audience laughing)
11:03
It was a master piece, I even kept on my t-shirt.
11:04
I called it hashtag Winnie the Pooh.
11:06
Puts a nice cartoonish (audience laughing)
11:08
but it keeps things light, all right?
11:11
Took the picture, right?
11:11
Tried to send it to him.
11:12
Got an error message.
11:14
Tried again, another error message.
11:16
I was discouraged, but I was determined.
11:18
I was like, this your homeboy,
11:19
you promised, follow through, right?
11:21
So I kept trying, I kept gettin' error messages.
11:24
So then I just gave up.
11:25
I was like, Fuck it, not meant to be.
11:27
Next day at work, I saw this dude looking stressed out.
11:29
So I approached him, right?
11:30
I'm like, Bro, what's going on?
11:32
He looks at me and goes, Napoleon at 4:30
11:35
in the morning, you sent me 17 dick pics.
11:37
(audience laughing)
11:44
I was like, Oh do you got them?
11:46
(audience laughing)
11:48
