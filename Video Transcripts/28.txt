I WENT OUTSIDE, AND DING. (GIGGLES)
0:55
(LAUGHTER) I WAS OUTSIDE EARLIER.
0:57
IT WAS A LITTLE BIT NIPPY AND STUFF.

NOT LIKE A FEW WEEKS AGO, I WAS IN THE OPPOSITE--
1:01
I WAS IN PHOENIX, ARIZONA. AND IT GETS HOT OUT THERE, MAN.
1:02
IT WAS LIKE 115, 120. OOH!

1:23
(LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE) IT WAS HOT OVER THERE, MAN.
1:28
THERE WAS LIKE NOT A WHOLE LOT TO DO BECAUSE OF THE HEAT.
1:30
SO, LIKE THE ONLY THING WE CAN DO TO ENJOY OURSELVES IS LIKE,
1:32
GO TO THE MALL, YOU KNOW? AND I GOTTA TELL YOU GUYS IF YOU
1:34
GUYS EVER GET THE CHANCE TO GO TO PHOENIX, ARIZONA, THEY HAVE
1:37
A FUTURISTIC MALL THERE. I KNOW IT'S HARD TO BELIEVE.
1:39
BUT THEY HAVE ONE. IT IS SO COOL.
1:41
YOU WALK IN THE ENTRANCE AND THE MALL ACTUALLY GREETS YOU
1:43
WHEN YOU WALK IN, WHICH MESS'S PEOPLE UP.
1:45
'CAUSE YOU WALK IN, RIGHT? 'DING.'
1:46
(AUTOMATED VOICE) "WELCOME (LAUGHTER)

2:14
"HUH, YOU, TOO, HUH?"
2:25
IT WAS COOL, MAN. BUT, YEAH, LIKE I SAW HIM
2:27
WALKING AROUND EARLY. AND YOU WOULD THINK IT WOULDN'T
2:28
BOTHER ME AS MUCH, 'CAUSE I'M FLUFFY, YOU KNOW, AND I GOT
2:30
INSULATION. (LAUGHTER)
2:32
THAT'S RIGHT. FLUFFY, I SAID IT.
2:34
IT'S THE POLITICALLY CORRECT TERM.
2:36
BECAUSE ONE TIME, I MESSED UP AND I CALLED MYSELF FAT AROUND
2:38
MY MOM AND MY MOM WAS LIKE, "YOU'RE NOT FAT.
2:40
YOU'RE JUST FLUFFY." (LAUGHTER)
2:43
AND SHE BROKE IT DOWN. SHE TOLD ME THAT THERE WERE FIVE
2:45
DIFFERENT LEVELS OF FATNESS. FOR REAL.
2:47
SHE SAYS THERE'S BIG, THERE'S HEALTHY, THERE'S HUSKY,
2:49
THERE'S FLUFFY, AND THERE'S "DAMN."
2:51
(LAUGHTER) MY EX-GIRLFRIEND, SHE WAS
2:55
FLUFFY, TOO. SHE WAS COOL, MAN, 'CAUSE I USED
2:57

5:01
AND IT WAS GOOD. (GIGGLING CONTINUES)
5:03
AND ALL OF A SUDDEN, I GOT A PAIN IN MY SIDE.
5:05
IT WAS ONE OF THOSE PAINS THAT NOT EVEN A GOOD FART CAN GET RID
5:07
OF. (LAUGHTER)
5:10
YOU GUYS KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT?
5:11
OH, SURE ENOUGH, I WOUND UP IN THE EMERGENCY ROOM AND IT WAS
5:13
THE SCARIEST FEELING IN MY WHOLE LIFE.
5:15
BECAUSE THE FIRST THING THEY DID TO ME WAS THEY STRIPPED ME
5:18
OF ALL MY CLOTHES. AND NOT IN A SEXY WAY, EITHER.
5:21
THEY TAKE ALL MY CLOTHES AND THEY REPLACE 'EM WITH THIS
5:24

SO, I SEE MY REFLECTION IN THE MIRROR, AND I REALIZE
5:36
AT THAT MOMENT, WITH ALL THAT GREEN ON, THAT I DO NOT LOOK
5:37
LIKE A COMEDIAN. OH, NO.
5:40
WITH ALL THAT GREEN ON, I LOOK LIKE (BLEEP) SHREK.
5:42
(LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE) (LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE)
5:49

6:03
OWN ROOM, RIGHT, AND I'M LAYING THERE IN BED.
6:05
I'M HOLDING MY SIDE. AND THE DOCTOR COMES IN.
6:06
AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS ABOUT DOCTORS.
6:08
THEY'RE JUST ALWAYS HAPPY TO SEE YOU, RIGHT?
6:09
"AH, MR. IGLESIAS, HOW ARE YOU?" (SQUEAKY VOICE) "I CAN'T FART."
6:13
(LAUGHTER) "MR. IGLESIAS, DON'T WORRY,
6:17
WE'LL TAKE CARE OF EVERYTHING. JUST ROLL OVER ON YOUR SIDE
6:19
AND I'LL BE RIGHT BACK." SO, I ROLL OVER.
6:22
AND HE GOES OVER TO THE WALL AND HE GETS THESE LITTLE RUBBER
6:24
GLOVES. AND HE PUTS THEM ON--
6:26
DON'T GET AHEAD OF ME, PEOPLE. (LAUGHTER)
6:29
HE PUTS ON THESE GLOVES AND YOU HEAR...

6:36
"DOES THAT HURT?" "UH-HUH."
6:38
"DOES THAT HURT?" "UH-HUH."
6:40
AND THEN THIS DOCTOR TURNED INTO A MAGICIAN.
6:42
OH, YES, HE DID 'CAUSE HIS HAND DISAPPEARED.
6:45
(LAUGHTER) AND IT REAPPEARED SOMEWHERE
6:47
WAYYY BACK HERE. AND I'M NOT GONNA TELL YOU GUYS
6:49
WHAT HE DID. BUT YOU KNOW WHAT HE DID.
6:51
YEAH, POKEMON, POKEMON. (LAUGHTER)
6:55
AND THEN HE HAS THE NERVE TO TELL ME, "MR. IGLESIAS,
6:57
I FOUND THE PROBLEM. YOU SEEM TO BE SUFFERING
6:59
INTERNALLY. YOU HAVE A BLOCKAGE IN YOUR
7:02
SYSTEM." AND THE WHOLE TIME I'M THINKING,
7:04
"WELL, PULL OUT YOUR FINGER. (LAUGHTER)
7:06
YOU'RE THE ONE BLOCKING IT, DUDE."
7:09
(LAUGHTER CONTINUES) SO, HE SAYS, "MR. IGLESIAS,
7:11
WE'RE GOING TO NEED TO FLUSH OUT YOUR SYSTEM."
7:13
"OH, OKAY, FLUSH ME OUT. GIVE ME SOME CRACKERS AND SOME
7:15

IT'S PAINLESS. IT'S QUICK.
7:21
TRUST ME." SO, I'M LIKE, "OKAY, I GOTTA SEE
7:23
THIS", RIGHT? SO, HE PICKS UP THE CALL BUTTON,
7:25
AND RINGS THE NURSE. 'BING.'
7:26
AND THE NURSE COMES IN. "OH, IT'S A SHREK."
7:28
(LAUGHTER) AND SHE WALKS IN WITH THIS
7:31
LITTLE BAG, WITH LIKE A LITTLE HOSE HANGING OUT OF IT, RIGHT?
7:34
AND I SEE THIS LITTLE HOSE. AND I'M THINKING "OOH, BITCH,
7:36

7:39
AND I'M NOT GONNA TELL YOU GUYS WHAT SHE DID WITH THE HOSE.
7:42
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT SHE DID WITH THE HOSE.
7:45
SHE MADE ME A WATER BALLOON. (LAUGHTER)

GUESS WHEN YOU GOTTA GO. RIGHT THERE.
7:55
AND THEY DON'T DO IT WHEN IT'S ALL CONVENIENT--
7:57
WHEN YOU'RE OVER HERE IN THE FACILITIES AND YOU'RE SITTING
7:59
DOWN AND YOU'RE LIKE, "OKAY, LET 'ER RIP.
8:00
LET'S DO IT. THAT WOULD BE TOO CONVENIENT.
8:02
NO. THEY DO IT WHEN YOU'RE LAYING

9:01
THIS GUY IS NUTS. THIS GUY IS ONE OF THOSE
9:04
COMEDIANS WHO TAKES IT TOO FAR. HE LIKES TO PLAY PRACTICAL
9:06

9:08
TO ME, AND SOMETHING GOES WRONG, HIS RESPONSE IS, "HEY, FOOL,

THIS CHECKPOINT IS DESIGNED TO PREVENT ILLEGAL ALIENS FROM
9:31
MAKING IT ALL THE WAY TO L .A. YOU SEE HOW WELL THAT WORKS.
9:34
BUT ANYWAY... IT'S NOT EVEN A REAL CHECKPOINT.
9:37
