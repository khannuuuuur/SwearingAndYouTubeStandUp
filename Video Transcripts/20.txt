MAN 3: What's going on, Boston?
0:15
(audience cheering)
0:18
Welcome to Comedy Central's The Half Hour.
0:20
(cheering)
0:23
Put your hands together for Michael Che.
0:25
(audience cheering)
0:31
Yeah.
0:32
What's up, Boston?
0:34
How you guys doing?
0:36
(audience cheering)
0:38
Wow.
0:39
This is crazy. I love Boston.
0:41
This is the second time I've been to Boston
0:43
in, like, the past month, and I love it.
0:45
'Cause the first time I went,
0:46
I went to a place I've never been before.
0:48
It's called Southie.
0:50
(audience laughs, whoops)
0:53
Yeah.
0:55
It's a white ghetto.
0:57
(laughter)
0:58
I've never seen a white ghetto in my life!
1:02
It was ama...
1:03
I saw a white lady steal a bike.
1:06
And she was wearing a helmet.
1:08
It was amazing.
1:09
It was the coolest thing I've ever seen, man.
1:13
This is, uh, this is cool because this is, like,
1:15
a dream come true for me to do comedy,
1:17
you know, for so many people, you know?
1:20
I've been listening to "Juicy" a lot to get inspired.
1:23
You ever listen to Biggie's "Juicy"?
1:25
(whoops) It's, like, the greatest song of inspiration ever.
1:28
You know?
1:29
I... It's weird though. It's not the same song
1:31
as when I heard it when I was, like, 12.
1:34
'Cause there's a line in there when he goes,
1:36
♪ Super Nintendo, Sega Genesis ♪
1:39
♪ When I was dead broke, man ♪
1:41
♪ I couldn't picture this. ♪
1:43
That's, like, $300-worth of merchandise.
1:47
It's not a lot of money, man.
1:49
I've been dead broke my whole life,
1:51
and I've had a Sega Genesis.
1:55
I didn't have a Super Nintendo, but I could picture it.
1:58
It wasn't like...
2:05
But it's fun though, it's good, because it's,
2:06
you know, like, if I wasn't doing comedy,
2:08
I don't know what I'd be doing, you know?
2:10
I don't know what I'd be doing. It wouldn't be good.
2:13
I'd try, like, I would try to get a regular job.
2:15
It's embarrassing.
2:16
I'd have to, like, lie on my résumé.
2:18
You know how humiliating that is?
2:20
You ever lie so bad on your résumé
2:21
that you can't believe you didn't get
2:23
the job?
2:26
You want to go back to Foot Locker.
2:27
Like, really, Foot Locker?
2:30
Who the (bleep) do you hire
2:32
that has eight-year mayoral experience?
2:35
(laughs)
2:38
And a degree in physics?
2:40
Who is this amazing
2:41
shoe salesman?
2:47
I don't have a degree. I didn't even go to college.
2:49
And I'm glad I didn't because I do this.
2:50
So I don't have to go to college for this.
2:52
And all my friends that went to college are in crazy debt.
2:55
Like, real debt.
2:57
I got a friend that's $80,000 in debt
2:59
with an English degree.
3:00
I learned English for free.
3:06
(laughs)
3:08
It was the first thing I learned.
3:10
It was the first thing I learned.
3:12
And I talk to this dude every day.
3:14
I understand everything he's saying.
3:16
He doesn't know a special kind of English.
3:19
He doesn't talk like the Game of Thrones.
3:22
It's just regular English.
3:24
And you know what he does for a living?
3:26
He teaches English.
3:28
'Cause that's the only thing you can do with an English degree.
3:31
It's a (bleep) pyramid scheme.
3:37
I do like, uh, doing comedy though because...
3:40
I got to pay taxes. That's the worst part.
3:42
That's the wor... You ever pay taxes?
3:44
I never paid taxes before.
3:46
It's an awful feeling.
3:48
I've had taxes taken, but I've never paid taxes.
3:51
And that's two totally different things.
3:53
'Cause when you have taxes taken, you get a job
3:55
every week and they just take the taxes out of your check.
3:57
They just take it. You don't get a choice.
3:59
They just take it and they keep taking it
4:00
till the end of the year where they're like,
4:02
"Hey, I think we might've took too much.
4:05
(laughs)
4:07
"Here's $500 back.
4:08
Go buy yourself some sneakers or something."
4:10
And you're like,
4:13
"Thanks, government. We're going to Red Lobster tonight.
4:15
"This is amazing. (laughs)
4:16
I love tax time."
4:19
When you pay taxes, it's totally different.
4:22
When you pay taxes, they let you keep all of your money all year,
4:25
and at the end, they say, "You owe us 40%."
4:28
Which is a lot for me because I don't know what I'm paying for.
4:31
I've never dialed 911. I put out all my own fires.
4:37
And I'm not saying I shouldn't have to pay any taxes,
4:39
but I shouldn't have to pay as much as somebody that votes.
4:41
Or... actually... (laughs)
4:44
I don't vote because I don't know anything about politics.
4:47
And honestly I can't believe they would let me.
4:49
Isn't that, like, an important job?
4:52
They'll just let me pick the president, really?
4:55
I don't got to take a test? I don't need a license?
4:57
You need a license to shampoo dogs in this country.
5:03
But they'll let me pick the president?
5:04
And that seems safe to you?
5:06
I don't know anything about politics.
5:08
I've tried. I'll watch the news.
5:11
Either I'm too stupid to understand the news
5:12
or I feel like they're always lying to us.
5:14
Right? I was watching recently.
5:16
This lady from the government gets on
5:17
talking about the economy.
5:18
She's like, "We're in a recession.
5:20
We owe China $11 trillion."
5:22
And I'm like, "We?"
5:25
I don't owe China shit.
5:30
You owe China $11 trillion.
5:33
"We" owe Sprint $90.
5:42
You must've been roaming.
5:49
We treat kids weird, man.
5:51
Let kids be kids.
5:52
They were talking about kids are out of control
5:54
for sexting each other.
5:56
They're not out of control for sexting.
5:58
They just have the technology to be as gross
6:00
as we've always wished we were
6:02
when we were their age.
6:03
What did you think he was gonna take pictures of
6:04
with eight megapixels of camera? Sunsets?
6:07
No, he's 12.
6:08
He's gonna take pictures of his dick.
6:10
It's the most interesting thing he owns.
6:12
(laughs)
6:15
It's not his fault.
6:17
I'm sure there was people trying to sext in the '70s
6:19
and '80s in their bathrooms
6:21
with Polaroids and stamps.
6:23
(laughs)
6:25
Like...
6:26
(imitates camera shutter)
6:33
Wait till Cheryl sees this shit in two to three business days.
6:36
She's gonna love it.
6:37
(laughs)
6:46
People in the '20s trying to sext each other.
6:48
With those cameras like the box cameras with the...
6:53
... with the black cloth and...
6:55
Poof!
6:58
They pose for every picture like they was on money.
7:04
All right, now watch the birdie.
7:05
Poof!
7:08
(laughs)
7:10
That's the world's oldest sexting joke.
7:14
I like that I'm... I like that I'm at the age that I'm at.
7:16
Man, I'm 30 now, which is a great age for me. I...
7:19
(whoops, scattered applause)
7:22
I'm glad that you're excited about that. That's good.
7:24
Like, more 30-year-olds aren't...
7:26
I asked a lady in her thirties how old she was.
7:29
She was, like, "Ugh, 22."
7:31
I was, like, "Really? Well, you look horrible."
7:35
(laughter)
7:38
What is the benefit of looking like an old-ass 22-year-old?
7:41
I don't know if she was trying to impress...
7:44
If she wanted to impress me, she should have said "47."
7:46
I would've been like, "Not bad.
7:49
What is your secret?"
7:51
Now I just think she's some sick girl.
7:55
I like getting older. It's fun.
7:58
I enjoy everything now.
8:00
I enjoy sex now.
8:01
I enjoyed sex when I was 20,
8:03
but I only enjoyed it for, like, five or six pumps.
8:07
Then after that, I was too busy trying to divide fractions
8:10
and remember scenes from The Color Purple.
8:13
Every... (laughs)
8:15
Every young dude in here has a trick to not finish fast.
8:18
It's not just me.
8:20
Women don't have a trick.
8:21
You finish whenever you want,
8:23
and we don't make fun of you, because we're nice people.
8:26
No woman in here was about to (bleep) early during sex
8:28
and was, like, "Oh, shit, think of Danny Glover.
8:30
Think of Danny Glover."
8:32
That doesn't happen.
8:37
There's books that teach women.
8:39
There's-there's no books that teach younger men
8:41
how to enjoy sex better.
8:42
There's no Fifty Shades of Dudes.
8:45
So I'm gonna write a book.
8:47
I'm gonna write a book teaching younger men
8:49
how to enjoy sex better.
8:52
It's gonna be two pages long.
8:54
And the first page is gonna say,
8:56
"If you feel like you got to (bleep), (bleep)."
9:01
And the second page...
9:03
(laughs)
9:06
And the second page is gonna be a bibliography.
9:09
That's all you need to know.
9:11
(laughs) That's all you need to know.
9:14
(applause)
9:15
That's it. That's it.
9:17
I'm dead serious.
9:20
I wish I had that information when I was 20.
9:23
I used to hold out. I don't know why.
9:25
I never won nothing.
9:27
I almost bit my tongue off twice.
9:30
Now, 30, if I (bleep) early, so be it.
9:34
Compliments to the chef.
9:37
(applause and cheering)
9:43
I don't even know why women would get mad.
9:45
I'm a guy. I'm supposed to (bleep) fast anyway.
9:48
My (bleep) is made of people.
9:50
(groaning, laughter)
9:52
Have you ever tried to stop 100,000 people
9:54
leaving a small area at the same time?
9:56
It's impossible. They got places to go.
9:58
I don't got riot gear.
10:00
This is my children. What do you want me to do?
10:03
(applause)
10:05
I'm just saying, men don't learn...
10:07
Like, no men learn about sex from a book.
10:09
Men don't learn about sex from books.
10:10
We're visual creatures.
10:12
We learn about sex from watching action films,
10:14
or porno, as you might call it.
10:18
That's why we watch it.
10:20
If your man watches porn, let him.
10:22
He's not gross. He's doing research.
10:25
He's finding out things that you might be into
10:27
because that's the only way we can find out.
10:30
You never tell us. We just got to guess,
10:32
and hope you don't call the cops.
10:33
And... (laughter)
10:35
If you would have told me before I seen it done in a movie
10:38
that some girls like to be choked during sex,
10:39
I'd be, like, "Shenanigans.
10:41
"No way, I'm not trying that bullshit.
10:43
"You're not getting me locked up.
10:45
No, sir."
10:48
(laughing)
10:52
That's why we watch it.
10:54
People get uptight whenever I talk about porn.
10:56
I don't know why. It's right there.
10:58
How could you not watch porno?
11:01
It's right there.
11:03
It's, like, right on your computer.
11:05
How could you not watch it?
11:08
Like, if... like if two people were having sex right here,
11:13
and I was telling jokes right here,
11:16
how many of you would be looking at me?
11:20
Nobody.
11:22
It's right (bleep) there.
11:24
It's not a weird thing.
11:26
I get why people watch love stories.
11:27
I get why you'd watch, like, a romantic comedy.
11:30
Maybe that's your fantasy.
11:31
You're, like, "Some day, that's gonna be me.
11:33
I'm gonna fall in love, it's gonna be beautiful."
11:35
And you want to live through the characters.
11:36
I get that. That's not my fantasy.
11:39
You know what's my fantasy?
11:41
I'm delivering pizza to a sorority...
11:44
(laughter)
11:46
...and they can't pay for it.
11:49
(laughter)
11:51
(applause and cheering)
11:54
People get so, like, afraid
11:58
to be considered racist.
11:59
I feel like people are so afraid to come off as racist
12:01
that they're not honest anymore.
12:04
You know? Like, nobody wants to be honest anymore.
12:06
Nobody just wants to say it
12:07
because they think people are gonna judge them.
12:08
I'll give you an example.
12:10
One time after a show,
12:11
these people want to take pictures with me, right?
12:13
White people. And I was, like, "Sure, we can take a picture.
12:15
That'd be fun."
12:17
I was, like, "Yeah, let's take the picture."
12:19
So, this white guy gets up, takes out his camera phone,
12:22
and he snaps the picture of me.
12:24
And when he snapped the picture, I noticed there was no flash,
12:27
so immediately, you understand,
12:28
I'm not in this (bleep) picture, right?
12:30
(laughter)
12:34
That's not racist. That's physics.
12:36
There's no way.
12:39
Instead of him just being honest and saying,
12:41
"Hey, man, we got to take this picture again
12:42
"because I'm not used to taking pictures
12:43
"of black people at nighttime,
12:46
so my flash is never on..."
12:49
Instead of him just being honest,
12:50
I just see a bead of sweat trickle down his face,
12:53
and then he tags me in the picture of floating teeth.
12:56
(laughter, applause)
13:00
Racism is a strange...
13:01
I don't even know how you could be racist in 2014.
13:04
We need each other.
13:05
How could you hate black people?
13:06
We... You need us.
13:08
You need me. I'm black.
13:10
We make shit cool.
13:12
Just like we need white people, because you make shit safe.
13:19
And we all need Asian people,
13:20
because they make shit affordable.
13:22
So, who (bleep)?
13:24
(applause and cheering)
13:30
It's true. It's (bleep) true.
13:34
That might be prejudiced, but I'm prejudiced.
13:37
I don't care. Prejudice-- that's a sign of intelligence.
13:39
Everybody's prejudiced.
13:41
I know you're not supposed to judge a book by its cover,
13:42
but (bleep), that's why
13:43
they put covers on books in the first place.
13:46
It's the whole purpose of a cover, man.
13:50
Judge me. I don't care.
13:51
I went to Tennessee one time,
13:53
went down South to do some shows.
13:54
And sometimes, people take you around
13:55
and show you what to do, right, in the city.
13:58
So, this lady-- she's showing me everything to do in Tennessee,
14:01
and she goes, "Hey, Che,
14:02
"I don't want to sound racist or anything,
14:04
"but you've got to try this chicken restaurant we have.
14:07
It's amazing."
14:09
And I was, like, "Why would that be racist?"
14:11
And she goes,
14:12
"Well..."
14:16
'Cause black people like a chicken a lot.
14:19
Which is a very hurtful stereotype for two reasons:
14:22
one, it's absolutely true;
14:25
two, you know who else likes chicken a lot?
14:27
Everybody with taste buds.
14:30
Why is it only funny when we eat it? I don't know.
14:33
How did that just become our thing?
14:36
Why is that a weird thing that we like chicken?
14:39
That's... I'm seriously asking.
14:41
'Cause there was a guy that made the news, a professional golfer,
14:43
he got in trouble 'cause he told Tiger Woods...
14:45
he said, "I'm gonna invite Tiger Woods to my house
14:46
and I'm gonna make him some fried chicken."
14:49
And white people was like, "Oh.
14:52
That is racist."
14:56
And I was like, "Is it?"
14:58
What kind of thoughtful racist
15:01
finds out your favorite food
15:05
and then threatens to make it for you?
15:08
He sounds hospitable.
15:17
Could you imagine that?
15:20
(chuckles)
15:22
Could you imagine if that's what racism was?
15:25
Just white people finding out stuff we like
15:29
and bringing it to us.
15:31
(chuckles)
15:33
How awesome would that be?
15:35
If you was, like, in Alabama
15:36
and the KKK just showed up on your lawn
15:39
with, like, white chef hats with the eyes cut out.
15:43
(chuckles)
15:46
Barbecuing.
15:49
(chuckles)
15:52
(laughs)
15:55
"Come on out, (bleep)!"
15:58
(chuckling)
16:03
(laughs)
16:05
"I hear you boys like white meat."
16:11
That would be the greatest racism of all time, man.
16:14
(laughs)
16:16
That one delighted me.
16:23
I got prejudiced people
16:25
in my life.
16:27
I went to San Francisco.
16:29
I told my friends. They all said the same shit.
16:31
"Yo, be careful over there in San Francisco.
16:33
It's mad gay."
16:36
Like I was gonna catch it or some shit.
16:38
I was like, "Dude, you can't catch gay
16:40
"by just going to San Francisco.
16:42
You can only catch gay in jail."
16:44
The thing...
16:46
(chuckles)
16:49
I only know that because I watch Lockup on MSNBC.
16:53
There's always dudes on there who've been sentenced,
16:55
like, 20 years. Five years in,
16:57
they've had sex with other dudes.
16:59
I've seen guys go five years without (bleep) before.
17:01
I've been to high school.
17:03
At the end of it, I never heard anybody say,
17:05
"Yo, you didn't get a date to prom either?
17:07
"Let's go (bleep) Phillip.
17:11
He's in the shower. Let's shank him."
17:15
That don't seem fair to Phillip.
17:21
(chuckles)
17:22
I went to...
17:24
I went to San Francisco, and it was cool
17:26
because it was during Pride Week and they passed gay marriage
17:28
that same week. It was crazy.
17:29
It was like everybody was celebrating.
17:32
(cheering and applause) I don't know.
17:33
I was... I...
17:36
You know what, like, I'm for equal rights.
17:38
And it's weird to even say that you're for equal rights.
17:42
Like that's a stance you can have in this country.
17:44
You can be for equal rights.
17:47
That means there's people out there saying,
17:49
"I think everybody should have the same rights
17:50
as everyone else." And there's other people like,
17:52
"Nah, son, I disagree."
17:57
People get weird about gay marriage.
17:59
I don't know what you... I don't care.
18:01
Do whatever you want. Do it. I'm not gonna do it. Do it.
18:03
I'm afraid to get married.
18:05
I still think I might be rich someday.
18:08
(laughter)
18:09
(chuckles) Whenever rich dudes propose, I feel like they're saying,
18:12
"Hey, I bet you half my shit I'll never cheat on you."
18:18
That's what happens to rich people--
18:20
they lose half their shit.
18:21
I watch SportsCenter.
18:25
Kobe Bryant's worth $150 million.
18:27
His wife was gonna leave him in a divorce,
18:29
take $75 million away
18:31
because she had to raise the kids by herself.
18:33
For $75 million?
18:37
I would've raised Kobe's kids for half that shit.
18:40
I don't even know them.
18:42
I would've breastfed 'em and everything, man.
18:45
I would've been a great mom.
18:50
Michael Jordan, greatest athlete of all time,
18:52
he lost $200 million in a divorce.
18:54
Then got remarried.
18:57
That's how competitive Michael Jordan is.
19:02
He lost $200 million, and said,
19:03
"You know what, double or nothing."
19:06
(chuckles)
19:09
What are you afraid of? What do you think's gonna happen
19:11
if gay dudes get married? What do you care?
19:13
I had a dude tell 'em,
19:15
"You can't let gay dudes get married. What's next?
19:17
People gonna want to marry animals?"
19:19
I was like, "Is that what you're worried about?"
19:22
Yes, probably. And who gives a shit? I don't.
19:26
I eat animals. If you want to (bleep) one,
19:28
that's your business.
19:30
I'm pretty sure I'm doing the worst thing to it.
19:36
(chuckles)
19:38
Well, if I was a goat and you asked me,
19:41
if you were like... (chuckles)
19:46
(chuckles) if you were like, "Hey, goat,
19:49
"would you rather be chopped up in this Caribbean lady's stew
19:54
or get blown by this strange farmer?"
19:59
(chuckles) it wouldn't be the toughest decision
20:02
I made as a goat that day.
20:09
Um...
20:11
I went way over
20:14
the allotted time, (chuckles)
20:17
but I had so much (bleep) fun.
20:19
Thank you, guys, so much.
