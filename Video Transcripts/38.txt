Announcer: What's up, New Orleans?
0:07
This is "Comedy Central Stand-Up Presents."
0:11
Put your hands together for Megan Gailey.
0:16
( cheers, applause )
0:29
( whistling )
0:32
Sorry, I was a little late. I had to get a fresh vodka soda.
0:35
Um, and I have it.
0:37
- New Orleans, how are you? - ( cheers, applause )
0:40
Yes.
0:42
This is my absolute favorite city to black out in.
0:46
( cheers, applause )
0:48
I just realized I'm dressed like a backup singer and I fucking love it.
0:52
I'm like the one white one with a tambourine,
0:55
that they're like, "They don't need her."
0:58
I'm so happy to be here.
1:00
This is a jumpsuit. I don't do regular pants.
1:03
I hate pants.
1:04
Whenever I'm sitting down I unbutton the top button.
1:08
Yeah, I wanna live. I wanna feel good.
1:09
I deserve freedom.
1:12
When I go to the movies I unbutton and unzip my pants,
1:16
and then I'm usually too high to remember I did that.
1:20
So then I'm just walking out of the movies and people are like,
1:22
"Wow.
1:24
She really liked 'Cars 3'."
1:33
You look just like Rihanna and I'm so mad you're in the front row.
1:36
It's like-- the fuck? I'm the pastiest woman.
1:40
Please, let's get Rihanna in the front row to throw me off.
1:44
No, you're beautiful. You're great.
1:46
You're cute, too, but she's better than you.
1:49
But you knew that. You knew that.
1:51
We're all hotter than all of our boyfriends.
1:53
We are. That's just what it is.
1:54
I travel a lot of places
1:57
and when you got to a town and the women are uglier
1:59
you're like, "Something happened here.
2:02
Something tragic took place.
2:06
Yeah, I don't know if it was like an oil spill,
2:08
but this is not the first batch."
2:13
I got a Brazilian last week.
2:16
- ( cheers ) - Oh, my God.
2:18
That's a "Whoo!" for my butthole.
2:23
The woman doing it was like, "Any special occasion?"
2:26
And I go, "No...
2:27
Well, it's my dad's birthday."
2:32
Like, immediately I was like, "Ah, how do I suck those words back?"
2:37
And she was horrified! Horrified!
2:40
She stopped mid-pull. Do you know how mean that is?
2:45
This is a woman who looks at stranger's clits for a living
2:49
and my words made her uncomfortable.
2:51
Like, do you know how disgusting of a human being you have to be?
2:55
And then I tried to make it better.
2:57
I was like, "Oh, no, no, no, no, no. He lives in Indiana."
2:59
Like that was the reason we weren't together.
3:05
Like, "No, I know he's my dad but--
3:08
You know, the distance,
3:11
my mom keeps trying to fuck him.
3:12
So, we're on a break."
3:17
I'm from Indiana.
3:20
Wow. Great.
3:24
I'm from Indianapolis, though.
3:26
That's why I'm, like, allowed to be up here talking.
3:29
People are always very surprised when they find out I'm from Indiana.
3:32
I have more of like a Connecticut cunt vibe.
3:37
I can say that word, I marched.
3:39
So--
3:42
( cheers, applause )
3:47
I actually didn't.
3:48
- I was on vacation, but-- - ( laughs )
3:52
I walked around a lot and that felt important, too.
3:56
Can you guys smoke weed here?
3:58
( cheers )
4:02
- Woman: Yes. - I have been.
4:04
- Man: Whoo! Whoo! - I know, I love it.
4:06
- Do you guys have dispensaries? - Man: No!
4:08
No. ( sighs )
4:09
Okay, even if you don't smoke weed,
4:11
I highly suggest visiting a dispensary once in your life
4:15
because everyone that works there is literally qualified
4:18
to work nowhere else on Earth.
4:21
I went to one in Portland, Oregon.
4:23
The girl took my ID, looked at it and goes,
4:26
"Are you in town?"
4:31
I was like, "Am I already high? What is happening?"
4:36
And then she went to scan my ID and goes, "Boop!"
4:40
With her mouth said "Boop"!
4:44
It's like, "Yeah, bitch, this is your calling.
4:46
Were you gonna work seasonally at H&R Block?
4:48
This is it for you."
4:51
I live in L.A. now.
4:54
I know my arms say otherwise.
4:58
Okay, well, that laughter felt hurtful.
5:05
I used to live in New York. Has anyone here ever lived in New York?
5:08
( cheers )
5:10
Yeah, what a piece of shit place.
5:12
- Man: Yes! - Woman: Agreed!
5:14
People are like, "Best city on Earth!"
5:15
I'm like, "Yeah, to see a stranger's dick, maybe."
5:18
Like-- and specifically to see a stranger's dick you didn't wanna see,
5:22
because sometimes you'll see a stranger's dick and be like, "Ooh!
5:26
That kind of spiced up my commute."
5:32
I remember the first stranger's dick I didn't wanna see.
5:37
Yeah, that's a children's book I'm working on.
5:43
Teaches kids about colors and shapes.
5:48
Like aah! Okay.
5:50
It's called "Me, Too."
5:56
My first apartment in New York,
5:58
I actually ended up having to move out of
6:00
because we caught our super climbing on a ladder
6:04
through our bedroom window to try and have sex with us.
6:09
What a New York moment!
6:12
Wow! Am I a Carrie or a Samantha?
6:18
The weirdest part about the whole situation,
6:21
he had keys.
6:26
It's like, "Listen, I don't wanna tell anybody how to rape,
6:30
but if the front door is an option,
6:35
why this Romeo and Juliet bullshit?
6:38
Luckily I was not in the apartment
6:40
when the super sexy time happened
6:42
'cause I was at the Giants' Monday night football game.
6:45
- Man: Whoo! - Okay.
6:49
I feel like that's a very important thing to point out
6:51
because it's actually the first time
6:53
the NFL has saved a woman from being assaulted.
6:59
Oh, yeah. ( groans )
7:01
( cheers, applause )
7:05
Did that hurt your dicks a little bit?
7:08
Weak pieces of shit.
7:12
This is a fun game.
7:13
Ladies, if you were sitting next to a man
7:15
and he didn't like that joke,
7:16
don't fuck him!
7:21
That's a bad man!
7:24
That's a man that's gonna go on HGTV and be like,
7:26
"I don't want a nursery. I want a man cave."
7:29
And you're like, "Run, bitch!"
7:35
He's gonna come home with a Hummer
7:37
and that's the domestic violence car, so...
7:41
If it's yellow, don't even pack a bag.
7:43
Get the fuck outta there.
7:49
I don't hate sports. I love sports.
7:52
People are always like, "Oh, my God! I bet guys love that you love sports.
7:54
I bet men are so into that."
7:58
Right.
7:59
No.
8:01
Men don't like to know they're dumb.
8:03
It's really hard for them.
8:06
Whenever a guy finds out I like sports
8:08
it always turns into some weird "Jeopardy" I didn't sign up for.
8:13
They're like, "Oh, okay. You know so much about sports.
8:15
All right.
8:17
Who was the starting second baseman
8:18
on the losing 1932 World Series team?"
8:22
I'm like, "Oh. I said I like sports.
8:26
Not that I was autistic."
8:32
Wow!
8:34
Some of you didn't wanna laugh at that and you did, so...
8:43
Do you play fantasy football?
8:45
No. No.
8:47
Just too busy making women come?
8:49
( cheers, applause )
8:52
It's hard.
8:54
Yeah, sometimes-- A guy will be like, "I'm in five leagues!"
8:56
It's like, "Do you know where a clit is?"
9:00
Maybe you should focus on that
9:01
before you're trying to make high-end trade deadlines.
9:05
Woman: Yes!
9:07
( cheers )
9:11
I love fantasy football
9:13
'cause I know where a clit is so I can play.
9:16
It's higher than you think.
9:24
I love it so much.
9:26
I was in three leagues last year.
9:27
I won every single one of them.
9:30
- ( cheers ) - Wow!
9:31
Oh, my God! The feminism is overwhelming!
9:35
It gets a little less impressive.
9:37
The first league was all comedians.
9:39
Yeah, it's like, "Okay."
9:42
I'm the only one with a computer.
9:46
Yeah, you can't, like, write it in a notebook and mail it to Goodell.
9:50
The second league was all my guy friends from high school,
9:53
so this one was really, really serious.
9:54
They really wanted to win. They needed this.
9:56
Like, I've seen their wives on Facebook, so...
10:01
When I won, they were so pissed.
10:03
Like, "You know what, Megan?
10:05
Fantasy football isn't even real!"
10:07
I'm like, "What? ( laughs )
10:10
That thing with 'fantasy' in the title?"
10:13
Like, yeah, I get it.
10:15
I don't watch "Harry Potter" like it's a fucking documentary.
10:20
I understand it's not real.
10:21
Also, I don't want it to be real.
10:23
Do you know how uncomfortable I would be with owning 11 black men right now?
10:33
It's like, "Antonio Brown, you are free to go at any time."
10:38
( clicks tongue )
10:42
You'll love it. There were white dudes that didn't laugh at that.
10:44
Like, "What? Oh, God."
10:49
The third league--
10:51
That was the-- the third league I was in,
10:52
an all-female fantasy football league called Sacks in the City.
10:59
- I wish that was a lie. - Man: Nice!
11:01
These bitches wanted me to lose, too.
11:03
They did everything in their power to make sure I couldn't win.
11:06
Right before we did the draft, all the gals got together
11:09
and they decided that we weren't allowed to pick any players
11:12
who had ever committed any violence against women.
11:19
It's like, "Uh, okay.
11:21
I guess I'll take six punters and Air Bud."
11:24
( laughs, applause )
11:27
Woman: Whoo!
11:31
I'm happy I went back.
11:35
I have one friend who's single left.
11:37
I'm actually not single, so please don't come talk to me.
11:41
My one single friend, she's very sad, but she pretends she's not,
11:45
so it's the most fun.
11:48
She called me last week, she was like,
11:50
"I just had the most incredible rough sex.
11:53
I got spanked, choked, thrown around."
11:58
And then she goes, "Well, his dick didn't really work."
12:04
I'm like, "Oh...
12:06
Yeah, you just got beat up."
12:13
Like, that's it.
12:15
That's what happened.
12:17
I like that she rebranded it, though, you know.
12:21
That's fun.
12:22
She finally put that marketing degree to use, but...
12:28
that is not what happened.
12:30
I'm like, "You didn't have rough sex. You just had rough.
12:34
You missed the best part of the rough sex.
12:36
It's the actual sex."
12:38
That's like having diarrhea and you didn't even get to go to Benihana's.
12:47
I worry about getting murdered a lot.
12:51
- I do. I do. - Woman: Yeah!
12:52
I get it. I know you can't act this way and be like,
12:54
"I'm gonna live forever!"
12:56
It's like I'm definitely gonna be in a trunk.
12:58
I know that.
13:01
I come home really, really late at night,
13:03
which is just like murdering women happy hour.
13:07
So I've developed a couple fun little tricks to try not get killed.
13:10
So like, when I get out of my car,
13:12
instead of walking down the sidewalk like a regular woman,
13:15
I choose to sprint down the center of the road,
13:19
constantly turning my head like that.
13:23
And it's less so a murderer can't catch me,
13:26
and more so another murderer
13:29
thinks I've already been claimed.
13:35
They're like, "Ah, no! Rick's got her.
13:36
Okay. Cool, cool, cool."
13:44
Men sometimes get upset with me. I get that.
13:46
They'll come up to me after shows and they're like,
13:48
"Why are you so political?"
13:50
I'm like, "Yeah, I'm just up here being like, 'Stop hitting us!
13:54
It hurts!'"
13:56
( cheers, applause )
14:02
I don't hate men. I really--
14:04
I don't want you to think that. I love men.
14:06
( sighs ) I keep saying that wrong.
14:07
- I love dick. - ( cheers )
14:10
Yeah. I do!
14:12
And people are so mean to dicks, too.
14:15
Like, "Dicks cause wars. Dicks are evil to women."
14:18
It's like dicks are magical, beautiful presents
14:22
that happen to be attached to monsters.
14:26
( cheers, applause )
14:28
That's what's happening.
14:30
Like, when has a dick ever texted you the wrong form of "your"?
14:35
Never. Never.
14:37
A dick never shows up in a Hawaiian shirt
14:39
to meet your family, like, "I don't know what the issue is."
14:41
Well, there's a lot of fucking issues!
14:44
These are my parents, not a goddamn Jimmy Buffet concert!
14:49
Dicks are so cool.
14:51
You guys have so many tricks you can do.
14:53
Like, a dick wakes up excited.
14:57
( laughs, applause )
15:03
Just ready to go!
15:05
Ready to greet the day!
15:08
What a morning person.
15:12
A dick wakes up before the human it's attached to.
15:16
How is that not on "MythBusters"?
15:18
That's the craziest thing I've ever heard.
15:22
Never in my 30 years I'm like, "Oh! My vagina's awake!
15:25
♪ Time to go to work! ♪
15:34
I love men, men love me, kind of, I guess.
15:38
My dad's very confused by my interactions with men.
15:41
Like, once a guy drove six hours to see me for two hours
15:45
and then immediately drove back six hours.
15:50
And my dad was like, "Why would anyone ever do that?"
15:55
There's no nice way to be like, "I don't know, Dad.
15:59
I just got that good pussy."
16:03
- ( cheers, applause ) - Hang on. No.
16:06
You can't say that!
16:09
You have to be like, "I'm witty!
16:12
I'm a Gryffindor and a Hufflepuff!"
16:15
( laughs, scattered applause )
16:21
I love when you go into businesses
16:23
and in the women's bathroom, they have signs on the wall
16:26
that say, "Please don't flush any tampons down the toilet."
16:30
And it's like, "Oh! Well, we are."
16:33
( laughs )
16:36
That's like exactly what we're doing a hundred percent of the time.
16:40
There's always a trash can out.
16:41
I'm like, "Fuck your trash can!"
16:43
I make 77 cents on the dollar, I'm not waddling to a trash can.
16:48
Hillary lost! She lost!
16:50
I'll flush a fucking shoe down the toilet if I want to.
16:53
( cheers, applause )
16:56
I'm gonna be postmenopausal
16:58
just dipping tampons in pudding,
17:00
fast-pitch softballing them.
17:01
"Do you still want her e-mails?"
17:06
And then my friend was like, "No, no, no. You can't do it!
17:09
It's like an environmental crisis.
17:10
The tampons get in the sewer, they clump together,
17:12
and then a man has to go down and break it apart."
17:15
I'm like, "That's the greatest thing I've ever heard in my life!"
17:19
No Google image search has made me come faster
17:24
than a man in a hazmat suit having to chisel apart
17:28
a Robert E. Lee statue of used tampons.
17:30
God bless America!
17:33
( cheers, applause )
17:37
I used to be a nanny.
17:39
- Woman: Yes! - Yeah, I worked with children.
17:43
I loved it. I nannied for a little French baby.
17:45
Well, his parents were French.
17:46
Yeah, he wasn't like a baguette I put a hat on.
17:48
Like, "Ooh! Bonjour! Oui, oui!"
17:52
This is a great job. I love this job.
17:54
The best job I ever had, I was a caregiver for my grandmother.
17:58
She lived with my family for three years.
18:00
She had very, very advanced Alzheimer's.
18:03
And Alzheimer's is an awful, terrible disease
18:06
that can sometimes be really fun.
18:10
I took her to see "The Dark Knight".
18:12
She laughed the whole time.
18:16
She'd be like, "The Joker is funny."
18:18
I'm like, "I know!"
18:21
She had a wonderful sense of humor.
18:23
Towards the end, she had to wear adult diapers.
18:25
So I would go down to her room.
18:26
She'd be completely naked but the diaper,
18:29
going, "I'm Donald Duck! I'm Donald Duck!"
18:38
My grandmother had a very, very tough life,
18:40
as someone born in 1918 is prone to have.
18:44
She lived through the Depression.
18:46
She served in World War II.
18:48
She met my grandfather there. They got married.
18:50
Unfortunately, my grandfather left my grandmother
18:53
when they were 35 years old for a 19-year-old
18:56
that worked at the snack shop at their country club.
19:00
All the men in here are like, "Sounds pretty cool!"
19:05
It was not cool.
19:07
Luckily, my grandmother forgot a lot of this, though.
19:10
So she'd come up to me and she'd say,
19:13
"Where's Bill?"
19:15
And I would say, "Well, Bill is dead."
19:18
And then she'd get the biggest smile on her face
19:23
and she'd ask,
19:25
"Did I kill him?"
19:30
Which puts me in such a tough spot.
19:32
You're not supposed to lie to Alzheimer's patients.
19:34
So I would always say no,
19:36
'cause I didn't wanna confuse her
19:37
any more than she already was.
19:39
And then once I knew she was really on the way out,
19:41
I just started to say yes.
19:44
And my mom would get so mad at me and it's like,
19:46
"Yeah, Mom, you don't get it.
19:48
Like, this is her Make-A-Wish.
19:54
This is it for her.
19:56
She's not gonna be a running back on the Rams for a day.
20:00
She's not gonna ask to slow dance with a manatee.
20:04
Like, she wants to think she strangled her ex-husband and got away with it,
20:08
and I'm a good fucking granddaughter who makes dreams come true."
20:13
You guys have been so much fun. Good night!
20:16
- ( cheers, applause ) - ( music playing )
