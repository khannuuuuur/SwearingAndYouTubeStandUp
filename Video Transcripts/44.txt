But I would watch this stuff. Fox News, you know?
0:02
Then I would get charged up.
0:04
Like, what the hell have they lost? White dudes.
0:06
What the hell are they complaining about?
0:08
Let me tune in.
0:09
Fuck them, man. They ain't lose shit.
0:12
And they would always get to this point in their rhetoric
0:13
where they talk about they're losing the country. I'd be so upset.
0:16
"We're losing, we're losing." What the hell did they lose?
0:18
"We're losing." What the hell did they lose?
0:20
And then I watched three seasons of "Mad Men" on Netflix. Holy shit.
0:26
They lost everything! They lost everything!
0:31
'Cause at some point, that was really their life.
0:34
That's what no one understands.
0:36
We can't think about it because we never lived it.
0:38
That was their life every day.
0:40
They could wake up in the morning,
0:42
bourbon on their breath,
0:44
another woman's smell all over their body,
0:47
walk downstairs, kiss their wife in the mouth.
0:49
She says nothing, just serves him pancakes
0:52
with the perfect butter square in the middle
0:53
like an Aunt Jemima box.
0:56
Just perfect pancakes.
0:57
They eat hearty like a man should.
1:00
Jump in their American-made Cadillac,
1:02
swerve all the way to work.
1:04
Swerve the whole way.
1:07
They get to work, run upstairs,
1:08
secretary greets them with double-D tits,
1:10
they have sex with her
1:11
right there in the middle of the office.
1:13
Just pull their dick out.
1:14
You're a white man in America. Why would you hesitate?
1:17
Soon as you're done having sex with her,
1:18
she says she's pregnant, you fire her.
1:20
"You're fired, bitch! Get out of here!
1:23
Who the hell told you to get knocked up, you whore?"
1:28
Go in your office, sleep off your hangover.
1:31
Wake up, go to a business lunch,
1:33
get drunk again, and get a promotion.
1:36
And that's what they did every day!
1:40
That was like their life. No interruptions.
1:45
And then, like, women started thinking
1:48
and black people wanted to eat sandwiches next to 'em,
1:50
and it all went to shit.
1:53
They lost everything.
1:56
That's why they don't want Mexicans to vote.
1:58
It's a slippery slope, man.
2:02
We gotta let old people be racist, man.
2:05
They gonna die.
2:09
Stop fighting with old people.
2:11
It's stupid.
2:12
This old people fight we've been having is dumb.
2:14
It's like, they're gonna die. Let them die racist.
2:17
What is it-- who is it hurting?
2:19
Who is it really-- old people aren't getting--
2:21
they just-- like, they vote sometimes,
2:23
they eat cat food. Fuck it!
2:28
Got to put yourself in old peoples' shoes, man.
2:31
Like if I was a Korean war vet,
2:32
like a real-- like, I went there.
2:35
I got all those little weird medals on my head,
2:37
them little pins,
2:38
I play bingo all the time.
2:40
The top of my head's dirty.
2:43
The bottom is still really white, you know?
2:45
One of those motherfuckers.
2:49
Buy my prune juice from the same store.
2:50
I just want to live my best life.
2:52
I go home on a Monday night after a solid game of bingo,
2:57
turn on a good Monday Night Football game,
3:00
and they tell me I can't call the Redskins the Redskins?
3:03
I'm losing my shit.
3:07
I'm flipping out.
3:08
Because part of why I went to war
3:09
is to be as racist as fuck in my living room.
3:13
Whole reason why I killed people.
3:15
That's like if I turned on the TV tomorrow
3:18
and they told me I had to spell Kool-Aid with a C.
3:24
I'd be like, "Why with a C?
3:26
I'd been spelling this shit with a K my entire fucking
