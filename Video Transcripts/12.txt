- Hey, Joe, who's playing the Metro tonight? - Kyle Kinane. - Kyle Kinane? Sounds like some Amish-dressing singer-songwriter.
0:09
- Larry, he's a comedian. - A comedian? - Yeah. - Dude, that's a rock n' roll club over there, okay?
0:14
Prince played over there; Joe Strummer played over there. - Yes. - Elvis Aaron Presley. - Did not play there.
0:20
- No, did not play there, but you get my point, man. You're gonna have some chucklehead pissing all over your stage over there, man?
0:25
- I'm with him, I'm with him. Comedy, as a whole, is just insincere. I'm sick of people calling it an art form.
0:30
"Oh, what's with this? "And I saw a dog walking down the street, and then this happened." It's just--you know what it is, it's fake.
0:37
- You think it's fake? You know, don't you do back flips in panties for a living? - Joe, I grew up at this place.
0:43
- Black Flag. - I was there. - Circle Jerks. - I was there. - Now you got some hipster idiot getting on stage.
0:49
You know what he's gonna talk about? - What's he gonna talk about? - Pizza farts. Pizza farts, Joe.
0:54
- Listen, if you guys were giving me the same amount of money as they're giving me tonight to put that putz on my stage, have at it.
1:01
The stage is yours, guys. - Well, in that case, drinks on Joe.
1:07
- Yeah, let's start a band. [laughter]
1:23
- Ladies and gentlemen, Kyle Kinane! [cheers and applause]
1:39
- Well... [cheers and applause] Thank you.
1:45
Thank you very much. All right, all right.
1:51
Wow. Thank you very, very much.
1:59
It's good to be taping a special in Chicago...
2:05
at Metro. Back in my hometown. This feels great.
2:11
Thank you for being here. I am on the road most of my life, so to come back home to tape a special,
2:18
it means a lot to me. So, yeah. [cheering]
2:25
It's weird. I spend most of my time on the road, and I have to leave my girlfriend at home.
2:32
And sometimes she'll make mention that she might be getting a little bit jealous, that when I'm on the road,
2:38
I might meet women after my shows. And it's hard to explain to her that I don't meet women after my shows.
2:45
I meet guys that look exactly like me after my shows.
2:52
Yeah. Not a line of babes waiting around backstage.
2:58
Just a bunch of hirsute fart factories, smelling like expired mustard,
3:06
leaning in, saying stuff like, "I get it, man." I'm like, all right, okay, all right.
3:13
I'm not sure what you get, but thanks for being here. Couldn't do it without you, fellas.
3:19
Glad you're here. It is.
3:25
Mostly, I'm glad about everybody who comes out and comes see me do comedy. Once in a while, an odd pickle will turn up.
3:33
Most of the time, it's great, but once in a while... Like, I was in Louisiana, and there was a fella in the front row.
3:42
He was like a real unpainted Juggalo type dude.
3:48
You can pick them out sometimes. Like, oh, man. You see them in the raw, you're like, "Ah, somebody hosed you off
3:54
for a job interview, didn't they?" And his wardrobe of choice for the evening
4:02
was a black t-shirt with white letters that just said, "I heart squirters." That's what he wore.
4:09
That's what he wore out in the world. Just wore that. That's like you're just dressing up for a mugs hot
4:15
with a shirt like that. And that's one thing. Like, all right, that's the sentiment
4:20
you wanted to put into the world. Like, what were you hoping for? What's the intention of wearing that?
4:26
Like you read "The Secret," and that's what you're gonna will into the world.
4:31
And do you think you're gonna connect with that special young lady who's gonna relate to that shirt?
4:37
You think that your princess is out there just going, "Oh, no fella's gonna understand me and my body,
4:45
and how I get all strange when I get excited down there." And then... And there you are.
4:51
You're right there with your "I heart squirters" shirt, like her shining wet knight, just waiting for you.
4:57
And it was in the South too. If you're in Jersey and that's your shirt, I understand. It's like, "Uh, I like squirters, see?
5:03
I put it on my shirt." But, like, the South, the South, you can finesse the language better down there.
5:09
It's a romantic region. You can massage the words to get your message out without being so direct.
5:15
Like, in Louisiana, I would expect more of a gentlemanly sort of effort, like, "I do enjoy the fountain-esque ladies."
5:21
And just, "Mm, mm." Wish him the best of luck.
5:27
Hope you find love out there. I'm been out a lot.
5:32
I was in Edinburgh, Scotland, for a month last year, doing shows.
5:37
It was a fine time. I said the whitest thing I've ever said in my life in Edinburgh.
5:43
Not anything terrible, but just white. Just white. You know, sometimes how you're hyper-aware
5:50
of, like, "Whoa, that was white." Like, where you even have to step back after something comes out of your mouth,
5:56
like, "Ho-ho, mm." "This tuna salad is pretty good, but it could use a little bit more mayonnaise, Barbara."
6:03
Ugh. Thought you were more well-rounded than that, dude.
6:10
Come on, man. "A karaoke birthday party on a Monday. You're crazy for this one, Timothy."
6:15
Egh.
6:22
But then, once in a while, you just top yourself. That's what happened to me in Edinburgh. I think the exact phrase I used in Edinburgh, I was like,
6:28
"I can't believe this castle doesn't have wi-fi." That was it.
6:35
It's not getting whiter than that, dude. That's it. You complained about brand-new white shit
6:40
inside of real old white shit. You just made a honky turducken, is what you did.
6:48
All right. And then, I went from there.
6:55
I went down to London. And I went on the Jack the Ripper tour in London,
7:01
because that's what I do, still. Like, I should grow up, but that's the stuff I'm into. And it's a big deal there.
7:06
Like, there's still big advertisements. Like, "You got to go on this Jack the Ripper tour." And it's from the 1800s, but that's still their big tour thing.
7:13
"Go on the Jack the Ripper tour." And you sign up for a tour, and there's so many tours. There's like competing tours,
7:18
and they're cutting each other off in the street. It's so popular. And you sign up, and you get assigned a tour guide
7:24
who's just a decrepit little English man, and he's dressed in the period. He's got a top hat and a cloak,
7:30
and he's using the scariest British voice. Or maybe just his British voice, 'cause it's hard to tell with the old ones.
7:39
The old ones always sound like they're just dooming you no matter what, you know? "What time is it?
7:45
7:30." All right.
7:52
He's leading us around the city on this tour. And the tour is interesting, but it's hard to focus on it, because you're still in a modern city.
7:58
So he's trying to put you in the time period that this all happened, and he'll stop you on some part of the street
8:03
where he's like, "And here, one of the victims was found, dissected with medical precision."
8:09
But you're still in front of a KFC. It's kind of like, "Eh." It's hard to focus.
8:14
I mean, I've dissected a family bucket with medical precision. "This tour is boring as shit."
8:22
But then we get to the end of it. We get to the big finale, and he's got everybody gathered around, and this is his big climax moment of the tour,
8:29
and he's got everybody there, and this is where he just sends it home. And he's got everybody, he goes,
8:35
"And it's believed that, in total, "Jack the Ripper may have killed
8:41
up to five victims."
8:54
Now, I know that this is a weird time to get welled up with national pride.
9:01
[laughter] [applause]
9:09
But I had to turn to my friend. I was like, "Did he say five?
9:16
"We've been rolling our ankles on cobblestone for three hours
9:22
"for five? "We paid Â£60.
9:27
"I don't even know how much that is in real money. For fucking five?"
9:35
And I got real USA. I was like, "I'm from America, baby. We got somebody killing five people right now."
9:45
And we don't give them walking tours, neither. You get a walking tour
9:50
for everybody that killed five people in this country, the whole 48 lower states would just look like half-price tickets at Disneyland.
9:57
That's what it'd just look like. Wisconsin alone would have so many people in there,
10:02
they'd be tipping off into the lake.
10:10
You kill five people, you could defend yourself in court after killing five people
10:15
and get off with, like, just, like, a warning. That's where we're at.
10:21
You could be like, "All right, yeah, "I know what happened, your honor, but listen. "You know how they say McDonald's "has breakfast all day?
10:26
"Yeah, and then you get your hopes up. "But then they can still run out of that shit. "And that's what they don't tell you
10:32
"when you're trying to have an egg McMuffin for dinner "and, like, 'We're out of Canadian bacon.' "Sure, I got a little out of hand.
10:38
I got a little-- I got a little out of hand."
10:43
The judge is like, "Rough weekend, I understand. "We all have them. "We all have them, we all have them. It was a rough weekend."
10:52
You kill one person on accident in America, you don't even get arrested anymore. They make you a cop. That's what happens.
11:00
[applause] "But I don't want to be a police officer." "It doesn't matter.
11:06
"You passed the test, you're qualified. Welcome to the force."
11:16
It's not--it's a weird time. It's a weird time. It's gonna be a very--
11:22
It's gonna be a very interesting conversation we're gonna have to have in this country
11:28
when there's a mass shooting that targets a group of people we can all agree don't really need to be around anymore anyway.
11:36
It's gonna cross that line at some point. Let's--I mean, all right, morose, yes.
11:42
True, yes. "There was another mass shooting."
11:47
"Oh, my god, who were the victims this time?" "Westboro Baptist Church." "Huh, hmm."
11:54
[applause] See, no, no, no, it's a senseless loss of--
12:00
I can't. [laughing]
12:05
Oh, God hates who? God hates-- I don't hear them anymore. I don't hear them.
12:11
[cheers and applause]
12:17
"Remember how you said you wanted to ban all the guns?" "I didn't say all the guns. "Did I say all the guns?
12:22
"What kind of guns did they use? "I didn't mean those, not those. The other ones that kill the nice people."
12:32
I mean, Fred Phelps died. He was the leader of the Westboro Baptist Church. He died; I'll miss him.
12:39
He was such a good villain. You don't understand-- you don't understand, like, how necessary a good villain is,
12:46
'cause a good villain unites unlikely groups of people, and that's what he did.
12:53
They're so terrible, that you had just people that you have no idea would even know each other are now on the same side of picket lines against him.
13:00
That's a good villain. You know, 'cause you had, like, obviously, the gay rights people and that whole community,
13:06
'cause the hated them for their tastefully worded signs they would hold up at all the street fairs and parades.
13:12
But you know who else would protest Westboro Baptist Church? Hell's Angels would protest. You were such a dick,
13:18
the Hell's Angels didn't like you. That's impressive.
13:26
You know, the Hell's Angels were also anti-Westboro Baptist Church, because those Westboro folks, what they would do was,
13:32
they would picket soldiers' funerals because they thought that American troops were dying overseas in wars
13:38
because America was allowing gay people to get married. And I don't care what kind of
13:44
spiritual mathematics you're working with. That doesn't add up at all.
13:50
"No, see, because of that, and now this." No, man, no. Show your work. Yeah, you can't.
13:56
You can't show your work. You can't show your work on that.
14:03
So, yeah, obviously you have the gay rights, the gay people against them, but then, also, you had Hell's Angels,
14:08
because bike gangs all formed from veterans coming back from World War II. That's how these bike gangs started.
14:14
You don't mess with the veterans without the bike gangs getting involved. So now you had Hell's Angels and gay people
14:19
on the same side of the line, just in their shared hatred of somebody. And you got to respect that level,
14:25
that you brought those unlikely groups together, just lining up side-by-side, just like, "Ha, huh, hey...
14:32
All right, yeah." "Hate these guys too, huh?
14:38
"Yeah, fuck these guys, man. "Yeah, all right, all right. "Yeah, they suck, yeah, all right, okay.
14:45
"What's that? "Cute vest? Oh, yeah, thanks, thanks."
14:54
"I like yours too. "I wouldn't have done all the fringe, but I like what you're doing with yours."
15:02
"Oh, the hell with it, you know what? "We're all going out for beers after this, "and I don't know what you guys were doing afterwards.
15:08
"If you want to just, you know, "hang out with us, have some beers. "Yeah, okay, cool, yeah, why not, right?
15:14
"Ah, you need a ride. "Uh, ooh...
15:19
"I got the bike here. "We're coming together. "You know, get on, yeah, get on, buddy.
15:26
"We'll handle it, you get on there. "Oh, look at that, you're getting on the front. "Okay, all right.
15:31
"You know what, it's a special day. "It's a special day. "Let's just let our hair blow in the breeze together.
15:36
That's what I'll say to that." Got to be appreciative of that.
15:43
I'm not even-- I don't know. I know it's weird with all the violence. I'm not even, like, an anti-gun guy or nothing.
15:50
I don't--whatever. That's my political stance. "Whatever."
15:57
I'm confused with, like, the open carry, where you can legally just have one, just...
16:06
Not even hidden, just have it out. First off, like, that's weird that you need to have it.
16:12
Second off, I don't like the term "open carry," because that's what I always would use
16:18
for, like, open containers. Like, you could just walk around with a beer. And so, then, the first of the year rolls around,
16:24
and they're like, "Well, these are all the states where open carry is legal." And I'm the idiot going, "Well, it's about time.
16:30
"I should be able to walk around with one. "I'm not hurting anybody. "Should be able to walk around with six of them, all right?
16:37
"Friday doesn't even get started "unless I get through six of them, man. That's what I'm saying." "They're not talking about beers, Kyle.
16:44
They're talking about guns." "Ha-ha, oh, boy, I feel silly."
16:50
So the beer's still illegal? It is? Okay, cool laws. Cool laws, everybody. Cool laws that make total sense.
16:57
[cheers and applause] But... I don't know.
17:04
I just think that if you need to have the gun...
17:10
there needs to be a dress code also. You can't just have the gun and then wear--
17:15
You need--the rest of this needs to match, 'cause not only do you have a weapon. You also have a very aggressive accessory now, all right?
17:23
You have a centerpiece to your outfit. It's the focal point, and the rest of it needs to coordinate.
17:29
That's what I'm saying. Do you ever see a woman out with a tiara,
17:34
but no ball gown? Just, like, sweatpants? That's a crazy person.
17:41
That's what crazy looks like. That's not someone making sensible decisions. No, that's a woman just yelling out,
17:47
"The Kremlin stole my babies!" And everybody is like,
17:53
"I don't even need to be in this AutoZone right now. "I don't even need-- "What did I need, seat covers?
17:59
"I'll get seat covers tomorrow. "I'm gonna let this weird, homeless princess
18:05
find her children." That's the same thing with a gun.
18:10
You can't just have that, and then not-- This--if you have a gun here, the outfit needs to make you look
18:16
like a responsible member of society, like you know what you're gonna do if that gun comes out of the holster. If there's a gun here,
18:22
this shit needs to look like John Wayne or Indiana Jones or Captain America. I don't know.
18:29
Something that people will be like, oh, he knows what he's gonna do with the gun if it's got to come out of the holster. I was in Colorado.
18:35
I saw a guy who was open carry right there, and I saw the gun first, and then I saw that it was attached to some board shorts.
18:42
No! Long pants! Long pants!
18:48
You have a weapon. Long pants!
18:53
This low-rent Johnny Utah shit, when you got it clipped onto some swim trunks?
18:59
With drawstrings? He's using drawstrings to hold up the weight of a gun.
19:04
You know how tight you got to pull those drawstrings? Now I know he's in a bad mood, 'cause his hips have been chaffing all day.
19:12
And that's not the attitude you should have with a firearm, walking around like, "I should have powdered, "because I'm just getting all red on my hip bone.
19:19
"What are you looking at? Stop looking at my calves!"
19:25
And flip-flops. Get out of my country. Flip-flops. Flip...flops.
19:31
I don't even own guns, but I know that if you're gonna draw down on somebody, 'cause you're one of those good guys with a gun
19:37
that stops all that crime-- thank you so much for how often that's been happening-- if you're one of those guys,
19:45
if you want to get-- if you want good aim, close-toed shoes.
19:51
God damn it! Close-toed shoes. Oh, you're gonna be--you're the one who's gonna stop a crime
19:57
when you just--you just-- you take it out of the holster, and then you're just swishing around in your Tevas.
20:04
Explain that to the cops when they get to the scene. Like, "What happened here?" "Well, I saw the perpetrator run out of the bank
20:10
"with a duffel bag full of loose bills, "so I deduced that he had robbed the bank. "And then, fortunately, I'm licensed open carry,
20:17
"and so I went and pursued the suspect, "but what had happened during that pursuit is, "I Jimmy Buffetted myself right on--
20:24
"I just straight-up Margaritaville'd myself "and blew out a flip-flop. "You know the song, Parrotheads, right?
20:30
"All right, yeah. "Anyway, yeah, I shanked it. "I shanked it. "That one went off.
20:35
"That one went off into the playground over there. "Fingers crossed, fingers crossed, right? I was trying to do the right thing."
20:46
That joke takes a wild turn.
20:52
I've been in the South. I'll be in Tennessee and stuff, and I don't know where open carry is legal,
20:57
so I have to ask. I'll be like, "Is open carry legal in this state?" And some people will be like, "Yes, it is."
21:02
I'm like, "Oh, thank you for just your monotonous answer of just yes or no." Sometimes I'll ask it in a place
21:09
where people are way too enthusiastic about it. Like, "Is it open carry here?" "You're god damn right it is!"
21:16
And I'm like, "Whoa." I just got to change gears real fast with that joke.
21:21
"You bet your ass. This is America; it should be legal everywhere." And all of a sudden, I'm like, "Man, have you guys ever had burritos?
21:27
It's like a taco got cold, you know what I'm saying?"
21:39
But it's--I mean, come on, we're in Chicago. It's easy to get all rah-rah, liberal, open-minded
21:46
and clap about that stuff. We're liberal, open-minded. If we're at this show, I would think we're not conservative, closed-minded people.
21:52
I like getting around my liberal, open-minded friends. They're like, yeah, of course, obviously. Yeah, open-minded people, open-minded.
21:59
If you're gay, straight, whoever, you get to marry whoever you want to marry. And if you're a woman, that's your body,
22:05
and it's your right to do want to do with that body. And if you're transgender, you're in a rough place right now
22:10
with the way laws are going on. But, hey, we're just pilots dropped into different vehicles in this world, and if you got to work with after-market parts
22:17
to get it to where you want it to be, you work with after-market parts to get it to where you want to be. Yeah.
22:23
[cheering] Yeah. I love being around all these open-minded liberal friends of mine.
22:30
And then I love just pouring ketchup on a hot dog. Fuck you. Fuck you.
22:37
That's right. Ooh, ooh! Sounds like somebody's taste buds are Republican.
22:44
Whoo, yeah. Pat yourselves on the back about being open-minded a little bit later,
22:53
when you can stop thinking about punching somebody 'cause they want to put pineapple on a pizza, you dick-heads.
23:03
I'm in my hometown. I just pissed all over the stage. What are you gonna do about it? I got paid.
23:12
[cheers and applause]
23:20
[laughs] This won't go on the special. I like that I think I'm being real punk rock by doing a ketchup on a hot dog joke.
23:29
I almost saw the singer of Samiam get a blow job on this stage 15 years ago.
23:35
But look at me, really blowing people's minds up here.
23:41
Ridiculous. [laughs] Thanks for being good sports, everybody. Really appreciate it, thanks for coming out.
23:47
[applause]
23:56
I don't have-- I don't know where I'm at politically. I really don't.
24:02
But I just like poking holes in all of it. That's the only thing I feel like. I think every side can be tested,
24:07
no matter what their convictions are. Like, one of the things, I'm not a gambler, but I like playing craps, not because of the gambling aspect,
24:14
but just because, if you're playing craps, and you're the one rolling the dice, you know, and you got a real hot hand,
24:19
and everybody's winning money 'cause you're doing real good with the dice. That means you get to yell out whatever you want,
24:25
in the name of luck, to test the greed of the people around you. And that's a fascinating position
24:32
to be in, in this world, where you can really push the morals of strangers just for a few bucks, you know?
24:39
You got to make sure you're on a lucky streak. You know, you got two or three good rolls in. And you throw out, like, a little tester.
24:45
You know, throw out something like, "Come on, daddy needs some new shoes," and be like, "Look at those shoes, those shoes suck. Let's get him them shoes!"
24:51
And, like, "Yeah," they're all cheering you on. But then, you get a few more in there, and everybody's chips are getting a little bit higher and higher,
24:57
and that's when you drop stuff like, "Man, these Laotian child brides aren't getting any cheaper. You know what I'm saying?"
25:15
"What-- What did you hear him say? "What--
25:21
"No, no. "He just said he's getting married in Laotia.
25:26
"We got to get him on that honeymoon. "That's what we got. We got to get him on that...honeymoon."
25:37
"Everybody down at the pet store knows what I mean "when I tell them I need a cage for a 'big dog.' [laughs]
25:44
Whoo!"
25:56
"No, I heard him that time. "I heard him. "He's gonna lock up those Laotian women.
26:04
"He's just confessing to crimes "he can't afford to commit yet.
26:12
"Yeah, I'm staying in. I'm about to pay off that Sonata."
26:26
[laughs] Oh.
26:32
Let's see. I've got gout. Ha-ha. Yeah!
26:38
I got gout! [sparse applause]
26:44
[indistinct shouting] What? Yeah. man: How old are you? - How old am I?
26:49
39. [cheering] Do you want to ask more questions, or do you want to just let me finish the joke,
26:55
and I'll probably answer them in the joke? [cheers and applause]
27:01
First, wait, are you worried about yourself getting it? 'Cause if you're at this show, you've got it, dude.
27:10
You all got it! [laughs]
27:16
Yeah, it's real dumb. I'm not being brave or nothing up here. It's a real dumb disease. It's real stupid.
27:22
Yeah, got it? All right, okay. Well, we'll get a support group after the show.
27:29
Yeah, it's real dumb. You just get it from just eating and drinking
27:34
whatever you want to eat and drink. I thought that's what I was supposed to do.
27:39
I thought that's how life worked, you know? "You should live life to the fullest, Kyle." I did; I got fucking gout.
27:49
They don't tell you the side effects of living your life by all these bumper sticker philosophies out there.
27:54
There's no asterisk on there telling you, like, "Oh, well, be forewarned that this might happen."
28:00
But I listened to all that stuff. "Just dance like nobody's watching, Kyle. Dance like nobody's watching."
28:05
But they're watching, they're watching. They're called security guards at Toys "R" Us,
28:10
and they are watching. I'm usually alone on this one.
28:18
I don't know if anybody else does this. Whenever you drive by a Toys "R" Us, do you ever just mutter, "We sure are"?
28:28
And then you curse the Illuminati for the rest of the day.
28:34
No? They're waving it right in our faces!
28:40
And we're not doing a god damn thing about it.
28:49
I'm a conspiracy theorist, but all my conspiracies are so low-rent, nobody else wants to entertain them with me.
28:56
Like, I'll try and talk with other conspiracy theorists, but I'm like the Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer
29:02
of conspiracy theorists, just trying to chime in. "Obviously, the mafia killed JFK,
29:09
because it'd be advantageous for them." I'm like, "I think Trader Joe's parking lots "are made too small on purpose just to make them seem
29:15
like they're more popular than they really are."
29:24
"That proves nothing. "That's not-- "Why are you even here, man?
29:32
"Anyway, obviously, the moon landing was fake "just so we could gain more funding for NASA,
29:37
"'cause it's really just a military complex that we're putting into space." "I think that--excuse me.
29:43
"I think that the FDA "is just making up expiration dates on food,
29:49
"because they're in bed with Kraft, "just trying to get you to buy condiments "when you don't really have to, "because mayonnaise doesn't get old.
30:00
"It just becomes Miracle Whip.
30:06
That's the miracle."
30:12
You know what that little extra tang that you taste in there is? You know what that is? Patience.
30:31
Fucking gout. It's so dumb.
30:36
All my friends are like, "Oh, my god, how do you get gout?" I'm just like, "Keep it up."
30:46
"You'll get it." It is, I got it from living, like, pleasurably and mildly recklessly.
30:56
Not like, you know-- not, like, totally going-- just mildly recklessly. And now it's a permanent condition that I have.
31:03
A permanent--manageable but permanent condition. It's like herpes. But at least, herpes, you got laid.
31:10
At least, if you have herpes, at least the universe gave you the courtesy of letting you get laid.
31:15
You can still like, "Oh, I got herpes," but then you remember how you got it. You're like, "Ha, yeah."
31:23
I didn't get laid. You know what I got? I got too many menu items with the word "rodeo" in the description.
31:28
That's what I got. That's not even a flavor.
31:34
That's the food telling me to hold on. And I fall for it every time.
31:42
"But what's it taste like?" "I don't know, but it wants to lasso my taste buds. Fill me up."
31:53
And it's real. It's a terrestrial issue in this world.
31:59
It's real. I don't deal very well with those. I live in this own alternate reality
32:06
that I've put together for myself. I live in this perceived reality that I created,
32:12
because I moved to California years ago. And California is a magical place where you get to pick out whichever age you like the best,
32:20
and then you get to stay that age, 'cause everybody else is doing it too. No, it's great.
32:26
You just get out there, like, What'd you like the best, Kyle, 19? You're 19 forever. Keep being 19, dude.
32:33
Keep doing it. Keep wearing skateboard shoes. You don't have to tell people that you have orthopedic inserts in them
32:40
because you have plantar fasciitis so bad that you tip over in the morning trying to take a piss.
32:45
You don't have to tell anybody that.
32:53
So that's the land I live in. It's just perceived reality. And then it's destroyed by reality reality.
33:01
Like, I found out I had gout the same day my ghost hunting equipment showed up from EBay.
33:12
That's one world being destroyed by the other one. It's just me at home,
33:17
just unboxing my EMF detector, all excited, like, "I'm gonna prove that spirits are real!"
33:24
You know what's real, Kyle? Gout--gout's real. Gout's real, but good luck looking for poltergeists
33:30
with a limp. Good luck doing that.
33:36
That's the world I live in. I choose to live there. I know it's naive, and it sounds dumb, but it's such a better option
33:42
than this current thing we're in now. "Ugh, can you believe Trump might be president,
33:48
and the ice caps are mel--" Ugh, drag.
33:55
You try and fix these problems. I'm gonna look for aliens. That's what I'm gonna do. Honestly, I know it's silly.
34:00
And I have no proof of aliens. I just want them to be. That's all I want. The closest thing I have to proof of aliens existing
34:08
is, I got in a cab once, and before I could even spit out my address to where I wanted to go to the cab driver, he put his hand on the passenger seat,
34:15
just leaned back to me and just went, "Man, it's hard being a human being."
34:27
"What were you before this?" 'Cause that's a comparative statement, you know?
34:34
You can't say that without having other experience. "Let me tell you, Kyle. "I was some peach yogurt for a while.
34:46
"I was one of those cacti in the desert "that look like they're being held up at gunpoint.
34:52
I've been a lot of stuff, but this one's tough." I just wanted him to look at the wheel of the cab like,
34:58
"What even is this? It's my first day."
35:06
That's where I'm at. This is an election year, with real arguments that people are having out in the world.
35:13
And you want to know the real argument I had three weeks ago? Werewolves versus astrology. That's the real argument that I had.
35:20
Pro-werewolf, anti-astrology, if you're curious. Yeah.
35:25
Yeah, I'm sitting there like, the moon isn't gonna dictate your mood. That's ridiculous. The moon can't tell you how you feel emotionally.
35:32
That's silly. Even though, I mean, well, I guess, the moon does dictate the tides, because that's gravity,
35:38
and that's the effect it has on water, and we're 70% water, so, actually, might be some science to that.
35:44
But, no, I'm calling bullshit on that science. But I do think that when there is no shadow cast upon the moon,
35:49
a select few of us become dog people that roam the plains. That is what--I will ignore all your science
35:55
and stand strictly in a faith-based position. Politically, I'm liberal.
36:00
Supernaturally, very conservative. I ignore all science and proof, and I go with my heart.
36:06
That's what I do; I go with my heart. Here's the catch. That wasn't even an argument with anybody.
36:12
I was by myself. I got to a bar early. My friends weren't there yet.
36:18
I'm like, well, I got files to short out. Fuck it, cage match. Sat there for 45 minutes with a glass of scotch,
36:25
agreeing and disagreeing with the empty space around me. Just, "Hmm, hmm..."
36:33
Everybody in the place is like, "Who is this guy doing a shitty Robert De Niro impersonation for?"
36:46
I went to my doctor for the whole thing. I went, and the gout thing.
36:53
And I looked it up online. I didn't just go to the doctor right away. Who goes to the doctor right away? "There might be something wrong.
36:59
Let's just throw money at it." Who has that? How many Rockefellers are you hanging out with? "Here's my money, tell me."
37:04
No, go online, sort it out. So, I knew it was gonna be gout. I knew I was gonna have something.
37:09
And I went in with that knowledge to the doctor. I'm like, "I think I have gout, 'cause this and this and this." And my doctor's just like, "Yep."
37:16
I was like, no, do your job. Don't agree with me. I'm at your office.
37:21
I'm not a doctor. Examine me. You know what, I think if you can go online and you figure out what you have
37:27
and you go to the doctor and you're right, you don't have to pay a copay. That should be the deal. That should be the deal.
37:32
I think that's fair nowadays. Like, I'm right, you give me 50 bucks. That's how we do it.
37:38
But, so I went in, and I was all panicked about the gout. I was freaking out.
37:44
I'm like, "Oh, my god, I've got a disease." And I'm just being a victim about it, like, "Oh, god, I have a thing."
37:49
And even my doctor was like, "Stop being a baby. "It's easily manageable. "Lots of people have gout. "You've got nothing to worry about.
37:56
"You can totally manage it. "All you have to do, you just have to avoid, like, beer and any food you might find at a barbecue."
38:02
Yeah, all I heard was, "You're gonna die." That's what I heard.
38:08
I know she was saying other words, but all I heard was like, "You've met the shepherd "that is going to guide you into the great beyond, Kyle.
38:14
And that shepherd's name is gout."
38:21
And I was just--I was freaking out hard about it. And my doctor is my age.
38:27
That's another weird thing, that a doctor is my age. You know, it's like, you're 39. How can you be a doctor already?
38:33
We're so young. We got so much more to go, baby.
38:39
How can you be-- What are you, like, one of them smart kids or something?
38:46
I'm 39. I still think I might be a prodigy at something. That's the level I'm working at.
38:51
I'm like, I don't even want to play chess. I'll probably just beat those robots right away.
38:56
I'll Bobby Fischer this whole place, is what I'll do. I do, I think I'm a prodigy. You know what kind of asshole that makes me
39:03
at a Guitar Center? Ugh. Just walking in, kicking the doors open. "All right, I'm probably gonna be awesome
39:09
"at one of these things. "Let's figure it out. "Is it keyboards? "Ba-dup bup-bup-bup. "Not feeling it, maybe it's drums.
39:15
Bah bah bah-- nope, that's not it." Every employee in there is like, "Normally, we would call this kid's mom to come pick him up,
39:23
"but this guy has male-pattern baldness and came in here with a cane."
39:34
I didn't realize that's what you could do with 39 years. That's what she did. Over 39 years, she gained enough
39:41
of this specific type of knowledge, that now what she can do is fix the human machine.
39:47
That's what she can do with four decades, is, she can fix the human machine. And what I did with four decades is,
39:53
I ate like a campground raccoon, so much so that I show up to her place of work
39:59
so I could take off my skateboard shoe so she could look at my too-much-bacon toe.
40:10
Different paths, man, different paths. None more righteous than the other.
40:26
And I hadn't been to a doctor in a long time. And so, since I was there, I tried to alley-oop it into a physical.
40:33
Which is--like, you could schedule a physical, but when you're just trying to ask, like, you're just putting your shoe back on like,
40:38
"Also, can we, like, look at other things? Check other stuff?" "Yeah, we'll do, like, blood pressure."
40:44
"No, no, no, like... "all--all of it. "Like, at stuff, can we look at--
40:50
"Can we look in stuff? "Can we look in--up stuff? "Can we spread some things apart to squint at other things?
40:58
"What I'm saying is, "get extra batteries for that little flashlight, "'cause I need a full 15-point diagnostic inspection,
41:06
is what I need." And to her credit, she--
41:13
We did the full physical when I was there, and to her credit, she transitioned into the testicular exam
41:20
portion of the physical smoother than any physician I have ever had. It was so smooth, like, I didn't even realize it happened.
41:27
'Cause, I mean, obviously, that's an awkward thing. It should be awkward. Even though it's a professional, it should be awkward.
41:33
You're exposing your genitals to a stranger in the daytime for money. You shouldn't be at ease with that scenario,
41:41
especially if one of you isn't a doctor. That's a crime.
41:49
You know, you shouldn't be-- you should be a little bit like, "Ah, okay..." You know? And I can only imagine--
41:54
I felt bad for her, being a female doctor, how many guys she had to deal with, just these undercover creeps that, like, function out in the world,
42:01
but they're like, "I'll crack a joke to lighten the mood." And she's like, "I need to check your testicles." "I thought you'd never ask, blaugh!"
42:09
Get out of here, you sex criminals. Fucking sickos.
42:14
And it goes the other way too. Doctors can be creeps too. I was in my 20s. Probably the last physical I had, I was in my 20s,
42:20
and I had an old man doctor, the type of age doctors are supposed to be, just old, and just checking their own pulse
42:25
to see if they're gonna live through the appointment. You know, just old. And, like, I'm getting a physical, and he goes,
42:30
"All right, I'm gonna check your wiener now." No, you're not, no, no, you're not. Did you say wiener? Did you say wiener?
42:37
You thousand-year-old pervert. You just said--you called a part of my anatomy a wiener?
42:42
You don't get this. You don't deserve this, and you don't get this, you pedophile.
42:49
And I know you're like, if you're in your 20s, that's not what pedophiles are looking for. Yeah, but I always shave my head,
42:54
and when I have no beard, I look like Charlie Brown became a real boy and got into pills. So I'm still a sweet, sweet treat for those creeps.
43:16
But she-- She transitioned into it smoother than any doctor I could even hope for,
43:26
because I was sitting there, and I'm freaking out about the gout thing. And I was like, "Maybe I just got gout last week,"
43:32
which is, I didn't know how you got it. It's from years of abuse. I was like, well, I was back home,
43:37
and I was eating all the junk food I would normally eat back home, but I was eating twice as much of it, 'cause maybe I knew there was gonna be a sea change
43:44
happening to my body. So maybe that's what I did, 'cause I was doubling down on all the crap that I like to eat.
43:50
I was back here, and I was at my favorite hot dog place twice in one shift. Not even in a day, in a shift.
43:55
That's a four-hour timeframe, 'cause hot dog employees are part-time employees. They're not there for eight hours.
44:00
That's four hours, I was back there. I should have just eaten the food in the revolving door in front of the place,
44:05
just eating it with my chili dog hands on the glass, just eating cheese fries like, "Well, I'm pretty much gonna break even
44:12
"burning calories if I just stay in here. "I think I might lose weight doing this. "Trish, hit me!
44:18
Nice!" And then just stay, like some sort of slob aquarium
44:23
twirling around in front of the place.
44:32
But then, my doctor jumps in. She's like, "Kyle, you don't have to tell me about eating junk food when you go back home."
44:38
She's like, "I'm from Philadelphia. I go nuts on cheesesteaks when I'm back there." She's like, "I'm a doctor; I should know better than that."
44:44
I interrupt her, I'm like, "Have you been to this cheesesteak place down on Sunset here?" 'Cause my doctor's in L.A.
44:50
I'm like, "Have you been to this place? "Is it authentic? "I want to know if it's authentic, because I like it,
44:55
but is it the real deal?" She's like, "Kyle, it's great. "I go in there, they import the bread and they do the provolone.
45:01
"I don't mess around with that Whiz. "I get the provolone on there. Kyle, that's an authentic place, if you want to know about it."
45:06
I'm telling her, I'm like, 'cause I've been to Philadelphia, and I went to those places you're supposed to go to,
45:12
that are across the street from one another, and they're on all the TV shows, and they were terrible. I got to be honest, those places were trash. My doctor interrupts me, she's like,
45:18
"I hate it when people go to my hometown "and they think that those are cheesesteaks. "Those are garbage cheesesteaks, Kyle.
45:23
"You want a halfway decent Cheesesteak, "at least go to Jim's on South Street for a halfway decent cheesesteak."
45:28
But then she goes, "But you want to know the thing here? "Kyle, the real sandwich of Philadelphia
45:34
isn't a cheesesteak." At this point, I'm like, "Do tell."
45:39
Oh, we're gonna do sandwich secrets? Okay, all right.
45:45
You want to bump some appointments? 'Cause if we're gonna talk sandwiches, I'll hang out.
45:53
I'll stay here for another two hours, knock out my deductible, if we're gonna talk sandwiches.
46:02
And then she told me, in just a very just knowledgeable, almost secretive way, she's like, "Kyle, the real sandwich of Philadelphia,
46:10
"what you want to do, "you want to find the Reading Terminal Market. "That's what you want to find, Kyle. "It's the Reading Terminal Market.
46:16
"You're gonna go downstairs. "It's gonna be a very busy marketplace. "Don't get distracted. "You're gonna look for a place called DiNic's.
46:22
"That's the place you want to find. "Now, when you get to DiNic's, there's other menu items. "Do not get distracted by the other menu items.
46:27
"What you want to order, it's a roasted pork sandwich "with broccoli rabe on to of it.
46:32
"It's a roasted pork sandwich. "Take off your pants. "I'm gonna check your testicles. Broccoli rabe..."
46:47
I've never been hypnotized before.
46:55
And, therefore, didn't believe it was real. It's real,
47:01
because that's what happened right there. Because I didn't hear her, but I did exactly what she said.
47:09
It's like, "You get the broccoli rabe..." I was like, "I had that sandwich. "I had that sandwich; I went there. "I went there, and no offense, first off,
47:17
"I went there and there was a line. "I had to wait in line for food. "This isn't Russia.
47:22
"My friend waited. "I paid, he waited, if I'm being completely honest with you. "He had the patience, I had the deep pockets.
47:28
"What--yeah, okay. "And, yeah, so he would-- "But I got to tell you, "we had it, and no offense, it was okay.
47:35
"The pork was very good, but the broccoli was bitter, "and it distracted from the flavor of the pork. "That's my honest opin--
47:41
[coughing] "It distracted from the flavor of the pork.
47:46
"And I don't--yeah, no offense to you. "It was okay, it was okay, "but it wasn't the best thing I had.
47:51
"I did have one of those Jim's. "That was a good sandwich over at Jim's. "I did like that Jim's. "That was a good sandwich at Jim's.
47:57
"What's okay? "My testicles? "Wait, what--what? "Wait, whoa--that was the thing?
48:04
"You just did it? "Ho-ho, shit, look at you. "Oh, you're a professional.
48:09
"Let me see if my wallet's still in my pants. "That was smooth. "You are a profe--
48:16
"I'm giving you five stars on, like, an Angie's List, "or wherever I can. "I mean, I won't be specific,
48:21
"but I'll be like, she's professional. Oh, wow."
48:29
Just living with my disease now. Just living with it.
48:35
It's tough. There's not a lot of awareness out there for it.
48:40
There's no ribbons. There's certainly not a walk for it.
48:46
[laughter] [applause]
48:53
It'd be condescending, you know?
49:00
I'm inching towards health. I'm getting there. I don't know if anybody else is in the same boat.
49:08
Like, I'm one Netflix documentary away from being a vegetarian.
49:16
Anybody else get to that point, where you just educated yourself into a corner?
49:21
Like, I didn't want to know that much. But you watch one because everybody's talking about it. You watch another one
49:27
'cause you're trying to sleep with a vegetarian. You be like, "Oh, that's terrible--anyway..." Then you just catch a snippet of the third one,
49:34
which is just some PETA volunteer yelling into a hidden camera like, "They boil them while their beaks are still on,
49:40
and they're alive!" And you're like, "Oh, god damn it. Well, there goes nuggets, shit."
49:47
I didn't want to know all that. So I'm still--I'm in the final stages of being an omnivore.
49:54
Like, I'll still eat meat, but I have to come up with character flaws for the animal,
50:02
to justify. It's like, I'll still eat a cheeseburger. Just know that if you see me eating a cheeseburger,
50:08
in my head, just know the dialogue is like, Kyle, do you know that the cow that made this cheeseburger cheated on his girlfriend?
50:15
Unacceptable. Num-num-num-num-num... Infidelity never tasted so good.
50:24
Aren't cows ladies? Whatever, it's my joke. That's gonna come back to bite me in the ass,
50:31
'cause I like going camping. Where I camp, there's bears. And bears eat people. So if I find myself in a position
50:36
where some bear just tears open my tent, is about to devour me, and then I got to defend myself, using words, 'cause I'm a small man.
50:43
I'm not gonna fight back. I'm just gonna be like, "Whoa, bear, "you want to think twice about what you're about to do here,
50:49
"'cause I'm almost a vegetarian, "which kind of makes me an animal rights activist, "'cause I won't shut the fuck up about it.
50:56
"So if you eat me, "that's one less person out in the world "fighting for your rights out here in nature,
51:02
so think about what you're gonna do, bear." And the bear is just gonna be like, "Yeah, well, we heard that you made your sister cry
51:10
at her own wedding." [laughter]
51:18
"Yeah, there's so many layers to this now. "First, that doesn't even make sense.
51:24
My sister's not even married." Bear's gonna be like, "Yeah, but we're just coming up with fictional scenarios to justify our actions, aren't we?"
51:31
I'll be like... [laughing weakly]
51:38
"Good point, bear, good point. "All right, ha-ha. "What do you want, salt and pepper? Yeah, you do."
51:51
I feel like I shouldn't eat an animal If I can't kill it, you know.
51:58
Not as a hunter. Not that. Which hunt--if you hunt, and it's all sustainable,
52:05
I don't care. I just don't have the free time to just dress up like the woods.
52:14
Hunting, if you don't kill anything, it just seems like the loneliest Halloween party.
52:22
"Look, I'm a tree."
52:33
No, I mean, just, like, me naked in a field versus the beast. Like, that's fair.
52:38
That's a fair fight of me versus the food. It's just--just MMA style.
52:45
That's fair. That's head-to-head fairness, you know. So red meat's out.
52:50
I mean... Cow--what are you gonna do to a cow? What you gonna do?
52:56
You gonna punch it? Go punch a cow. Tell me how you feel in your soul.
53:05
Go find a cow. Go find just a long-lashed, blinking, chewing,
53:11
peaceful bovine, and you just come out of the tall grass, getting loose on it.
53:17
Just...
53:22
Punch that cow in the face. That'll break your heart faster than cholesterol ever could.
53:28
There's nothing. What are you gonna do, sweep a leg? Go for it; it's got four of them. Now it's got three.
53:34
Now you made a tripod. That's even more structurally sound than the original creature.
53:41
That's built for high winds now. That's why they work well in the plains.
53:49
Side note. Tornadoes are the dick-heads of natural disasters,
53:56
because they're so personal, you know? You ever think about that? Like, it's tragic, but it's--
54:02
Like, a flood, that hits everybody.
54:07
Blizzard, hits everybody. Earthquake, hits everybody.
54:14
Tornado... maybe just Jeff's house.
54:23
How do you not take that personal if you're Jeff, you know?
54:29
"Oh, what's that, Dave? "You're house is okay? "All right, cool. "Trish, your place is fine?
54:35
"Good-looking. What the fuck is this, then?"
54:43
"Oh, what's that? "You want me to talk to your insurance, Trish, "'cause my dog scratched your car
54:48
"when it hit it at 90 miles an hour?
54:55
"Oh, you think that can be filed under an act of God claim. "What god, Trish?
55:00
What fucking god?"
55:17
Chicken. Try and dip back into the other joke.
55:23
That tornado thing is just unplanned.
55:30
Chicken. You could accidentally kill a chicken. That might not even be your fault, you know?
55:37
You could just be friends with a chicken, Out there, hanging out with your buddy, you know, Frederick, or whatever,
55:44
whatever you name your-- if you write the joke and name it, what you want to name it.
55:51
Chasing around the yard. "Ha-ha, Freddie, come on now." All of a sudden, you trip, take a knee right on the back of Frederick.
55:58
"Oh, no! Oh, god!"
56:07
"It wasn't supposed to be like this!
56:13
Frederick!"
56:23
[laughter] [sobs and grunts]
56:32
You got to pluck them while they're still warm.
56:42
Fish. Fish aren't real.
56:49
No. That's just food. Fish is--that's all it is. That's what it's meant to be.
56:55
You could just bite a fish right now, and that's the food. You don't have to do anything to it.
57:01
You could just bite it and, "Mm." You're supposed to do that to it, then.
57:06
If that's how it tastes, just like that, you're supposed to eat it. That's all--you got to put more effort into a potato
57:13
than you do a fish. You got to grow a potato, dig up a potato,
57:20
you got to rinse off a potato. Fish is rinsing itself off right now.
57:26
Fish's whole existence is just rinsing itself off, waiting for you to make up your mind when you want to eat it.
57:32
Every fish out there right now is like, "Are you hungry now? "How about now? Just let me know."
57:38
That's a wet vegetable. That's all that is.
57:47
We still catch fish. That's how dumb fish are. We still catch fish.
57:52
They're too dumb to not be food if we still catch fish. Fish live in the ocean.
58:00
That's the biggest thing.
58:09
Think of things. Now prioritize that list in order of size.
58:20
Where's the ocean? Maybe not even the biggest.
58:26
I'll give you the galaxy, the sky, the ocean. Third biggest thing.
58:32
That's its getaway room. And we still catch them,
58:37
'cause they're still down there, just like, "Hm-hm, what is that, a worm on a hook?
58:44
"Ho-ho-ho, I don't know. "Because I hate hooks, you know.
58:52
But I love worms!"
58:57
Sorry, stupid, you live in this aquarium now. We still catch whole groups of them at once.
59:04
That's how dumb they are. Who groups of them are down there like, "Guys, guys, look! They put down one of those big hammocks for us again."
59:15
They're too dumb to live. How could you be so stupid when you swim in a school?
59:21
Not a good joke. No. The balcony's right. They laugh at it at all.
59:28
It's not a good joke. It's mildly clever. I keep it in the set because I'm impressed with the mild cleverness of it,
59:37
that my brain was still like, "Look what you did. "They swim in schools, but they're not bright. That's a good thing, the way you put those words together."
59:43
And because I thought of that, to me, it makes up for something stupid I've done in my personal life, 'cause we're all just seeking balance in this world.
59:50
So I'm like, good job, yeah, that's a clever joke, Kyle. That almost makes up for the time that you tried to iron a shirt using the bottom of a hot pot of coffee.
1:00:07
Searching for balance, man.
1:00:14
Oh, shit. We're almost out of time. woman: No.
1:00:20
- No, don't, stop it.
1:00:27
I got some weird jokes that don't really fit anywhere else in the set, so I'll try those.
1:00:32
I can't handle old people with real blue eyes.
1:00:42
You ever see old people with just, like, crystal-blue eyes? Ugh.
1:00:47
They look like they could only remember their friends who've died. It's too much.
1:00:55
"Birthdays? "I love birthdays. Jeremy had birthdays."
1:01:01
Fuck off. Need to blink or something, Jesus.
1:01:08
Don't your eyes get dry looking at ghosts all day? God damn.
1:01:23
I feel very fortunate that I get to do this, 'cause it's not a real thing.
1:01:31
Like, real in, you know, the three-dimensional sense that we're here.
1:01:37
Mostly conscious. Can't speak for some of you in the back.
1:01:42
man: Yeah. [laughter] - Prove my point.
1:01:52
But it's not like-- this isn't a skill, you know? It's a nice thing, but it's not a skill.
1:01:57
It's not a skill in the sense that it's necessary for the world. Like, if the shit goes down, my job disappears, you know?
1:02:07
So it's nice, but it's not a necessity. You don't hear the apocalypse purveyors
1:02:12
and the doomsday preppers who are out in the forest trying to disguise an abandoned school bus
1:02:20
on the side of a hill, you never hear them saying something like, "Trish, Trish! "Before you finish pickling those yams,
1:02:28
"we must go into the city center and lure us back a clown."
1:02:38
"Because in addition to preserved foods and fresh water, "we must also be able to ensure that we can tee-hee
1:02:45
while society crumbles around us."
1:02:51
That's not what this is. All this is, is a personality trait
1:02:56
I'm trying to capitalize on. That's it. That's it. You ever meet a comedian with an ego,
1:03:03
kick him to the curb. You don't get to have an ego. All this is, is just somebody was like, "Hey, man, you were pretty funny at that party last weekend."
1:03:10
I'm just like, "Yeah, you want to give me 20 bucks?"
1:03:17
That's it. That's what I'm trying to say, is, thanks, chumps.
1:03:22
Kidding, joke, it's a joke. We're pals, joke.
1:03:28
No, that's why--I know things are well for me. And I feel grateful.
1:03:34
I feel like, you know, karmically, I'm on the heavy end of the seesaw right now. Okay, yeah, things are going good, buddy.
1:03:40
Things are all right. But like I said before, balance is always restored in the world. So I don't know how much time I have
1:03:46
being in charge of the way things are. I think the balance will be restored. And it'll be restored in some sort of, like,
1:03:52
forceful, immediate thrust, you know? I always feel like I'm gonna "Freaky Friday" switch
1:03:58
with somebody that has an actual skill set. That's how the balance will be restored. Like, I'll get found out for the fraud that I am.
1:04:05
My file fell through the cracks of the karmic offices, and eventually they'll dig it up and be like, "Oh, we forget to check in on this guy."
1:04:11
"What's he been doing?" "Well, sometimes he tells jokes about crab legs for 35 minutes."
1:04:17
"Well, that sounds like a really dumb way to go through life. But whatever, to each their own, you know?" "Yeah, but it says here,
1:04:22
his credit cards are paid off 'cause of that." "Well, that's not fair at all. No, sir, no."
1:04:30
And that "Freaky Friday" switch is gonna happen, and maybe not even somebody with a skill set we can all agree is amazing,
1:04:37
like astronauts or surgeons, where we could look at them like, I have no idea how you could even get to that point.
1:04:43
Maybe it's just a skill set that we overlook or maybe judge somebody for utilizing, you know?
1:04:48
Like, whenever you see, like, a tractor trailer driver, a big rig driver, down in the busy section of the city, you know,
1:04:56
trying to manipulate that vehicle, and then you hear the beeping start, 'cause you know that they got to go in reverse
1:05:01
and back up into a loading dock. That's when I get scared...
1:05:06
of being that guy. 'Cause nobody appreciates that guy. Nobody stands back and is like,
1:05:13
"Wow, look at the skill that this guy learned and is now demonstrating." No, everybody's just in their cars,
1:05:19
lining up on either side, with their hands over their horns like game show buzzers, like, "Turn the wheel wrong once, motherfucker!
1:05:27
Turn it wrong once, and you will hear our wrath!" 'Cause everybody's in rush hour,
1:05:33
which is this weird backwards race to see who can get to whose shittier day sooner. You know, what a great prize
1:05:39
you're all running towards the finish line for. So when I see somebody doing something like that,
1:05:45
that's when I'm like, "Oh, man, that looks like it's probably pretty tough." And then some OCD thought will be like, "Don't look at the sun and blink three times,
1:05:52
or you'll become him." And it's like, "Egh!" 'Cause you can't un-think that kind of thought.
1:05:57
You're just like, "I won't! "I'm not gonna! "Aw, fuck it. Yeah!"
1:06:03
And then I'm just gonna warp into the cab of that truck, just like, "There's so many gears!"
1:06:11
"What? "It's just--what? "I'm jack-knifing, I'm jack-knifing!
1:06:16
"I never even knew what it meant before, "but now I know what it means. "What are we hauling, important stuff?
1:06:23
"If it's important stuff, I can focus. "What is it? "Refurbished VCRs?
1:06:30
Nobody even needs these!" So that's the world that I live in,
1:06:37
is just very appreciative and grateful,
1:06:42
with just this overlying tone of paranoia at all times,
1:06:48
that I will walk through the world just skipping and singing and glad about stuff, and all of a sudden, it's like, "Hey, Kyle,
1:06:55
did you take that staircase in odd steps or even steps?" "It was odd steps."
1:07:00
"Oh-ho-ho-ho. Now you got to be a Benihana chef for 20 minutes."
1:07:07
That should scare the shit out of everybody in here. That should scare the living shit out of you,
1:07:12
having to be a Benihana chef. Not only do you have to be a chef, but you have to be a Cirque du Soleil performer too.
1:07:18
That's terrifying to all-- Even if you're already a regular chef, that should still scare you.
1:07:23
'Cause I get it, chefs, you're the new bad boys. All right, we get it, we all get it. The chefs are the new bad boys around town.
1:07:29
You're all tatted up, and you're the new rock 'n rollers. And Anthony Bourdain did heroin and wrote a book,
1:07:36
so now we got to listen to all your bullshit stories at the bar at the end of the night. Oh, yeah, oh, fuckin', yeah.
1:07:43
Nobody else has ever done coke. So why don't you keep rambling over there? Oh, my god.
1:07:48
"Is that Charles Bukowski in the body of a young Mick Jagger?"
1:07:54
No, that's Lewis, and he works at Steak 'n Shake, and he won't shut the fuck up about it. But I get it.
1:07:59
You're the new cool dudes around town. Just all tatted up.
1:08:04
You're on the cover of the local arts magazines, tatted up, in your chef's whites, and your tall hat, and your egg whisk neck tattoo,
1:08:11
and then the caption-- you're just standing there like an MMA fighter, and the caption's like, "Is this the new face of pasta primavera?"
1:08:18
And you're like, "Ergh!" Calm down, cookie.
1:08:25
I know a chef too. His name's Mike Rowave, all right? Take a break, take a break.
1:08:31
Take five. Eight-six your attitude.
1:08:38
If that joke makes the special, that will guarantee that all the food I eat will be spit in for the rest of my life.
1:08:46
That's a risk I'll take for art!
1:08:54
But even if you're that guy, even if you're a regular chef, you get to hide in a kitchen. You get that wall.
1:08:59
So you can have your regular chef trickery back there, and your secrets you can preserve in your little clubhouse.
1:09:05
And if shit's going on back there, we all know what happens. We allow what happens back there when it's busy
1:09:10
and somebody's like, "You dropped that pork chop." You're like, "I didn't drop shit; send it out." We all know, and we allow it, we allow that. If it's a good pork chop, we allow that,
1:09:16
because we trust your artistry, and why should a little bit of floor interrupt that artistry? We allow that, because that's what happens back there.
1:09:23
I once ate Chinese food with a rock in it.
1:09:31
A rock. That's from the ground.
1:09:40
That's not a hair that flutters or a bug that flies. That's the ground.
1:09:46
That means that somebody dropped that Chinese food. I don't know if you know this about Chinese food.
1:09:52
You don't even drop some... of the Chinese food.
1:09:58
It's not compartmentalized. It's not like, oh, that one noodle was indicative to the dish.
1:10:03
You either never drop the Chinese food, or you start making all new Chinese food,
1:10:09
Because all of it slid out like a wet wig onto the floor.
1:10:18
That's what happened. Somebody got a dustpan and then served it to me.
1:10:23
And it was so good, I looked around for more rocks, didn't find any, clean plate club. That's what I did,
1:10:29
out of respect for the person making that Chinese food. But a Benihana chef, you don't get that liberty.
1:10:37
You don't get that freedom. You're on the front lines. You're a magician with no sleeves. You can't hide tricks.
1:10:43
Imagine, just imagine dropping into that position right now as balance for the world, being forced into that,
1:10:48
just bang, you're that guy. Oh, god. Okay, what's happening?
1:10:54
I'll figure it out. Am I a poker dealer? Why is this table on fire?
1:11:00
Okay, no, I get it, I understand, I know where I am. I'm one of those guys. Oh, shit, I'm one of those guys.
1:11:05
Oh, god, why are there children here? Get away, this is dangerous! Oh, god, okay.
1:11:11
Mm, mm, mm, okay. We're gonna get this, we're gonna get through this. Who's here, who's here? Brian's here.
1:11:17
Hey, Brian! It's your birthday, oh, shit, all right. Uh, uh...
1:11:23
âª Happy birthday, it's Brian's birthday âª We don't do a song here. Nobody's singing with me, buddy. I don't know.
1:11:28
I guess we don't do that. What do you want? What do you want for your birthday dinner, Brian? You want me to turn a half an onion
1:11:35
into a volcano choo-choo train.
1:11:41
What does that even mean? Is that like a metaphor?
1:11:47
Or like a Red Hot Chili Peppers lyric? I don't know. [crying, whining]
1:11:55
Ah! Ha-ha, choo-choo! Choo, choo...
1:12:01
Under a bridge-- I don't know, I don't know. [crying] Okay, okay.
1:12:07
Who else is here? Trish, hi, Trish, Trish. Trish, you showed up in another joke.
1:12:13
That's great. That's really great. You're really doing a lot of heavy lifting during this set.
1:12:19
We really appreciate it down at headquarters. What do you want for Brian's birthday dinner, Trish?
1:12:27
Shrimp? Yes, Trish, I can do shrimp. Shrimp's easy. It's clear, and then it's not, and then it's done, yeah!
1:12:34
Okay, all right, good, good. Wait, what? Oh, I can't just make the shrimp? No, of course not.
1:12:40
You want me to cut the tails off, and then you want me to balance them on the end on by biggest, sharpest knife, huh?
1:12:48
You want me to flip them into the air and catch them in my hat.
1:12:54
Are you fucking with me right now, Trish? Oh, god.
1:13:02
And you're just so tense and nervous and wound up and confused. You're just like, "Ah, ah...
1:13:07
Knives!" And now you just caught nine manslaughter charges,
1:13:12
'cause you killed Brian's whole office birthday party, 'cause you couldn't handle the restoration of balance.
1:13:19
But if it's a true "Freaky Friday" switch, that means that the Benihana chef
1:13:24
has to show up here in my place and do my job, and maybe it's not as easy as it seems like to the outside world.
1:13:30
'Cause it'd be a night like tonight, but maybe it'd be a night where I have my joke notebook out on the stool here.
1:13:36
But the thing is, I don't ever write jokes in my joke notebook. I just write down the idea for jokes,
1:13:43
and then positive affirmations listed afterwards, 'cause that's my writing process.
1:13:48
So maybe a guy would just pop in here with a cummberbund and a tall hat full of shrimp parts, you know,
1:13:56
with some initial confusion, and be like, oh, this is pretty strange. What's happening here? Oh, there's some instructions, cool.
1:14:03
And then he goes over to read the instructions, but all it says is, "Don't say 'spooktacular' unless it's Halloween,
1:14:10
otherwise you'll sound like a gay racist." What? [laughter]
1:14:16
[applause]
1:14:26
And then he'll look for some sort of explanation, but there's no explanation. Underneath, it just says, "Don't worry, buddy.
1:14:32
You'll figure it out." Chicago, thank you so much for coming to my show.
1:14:38
I really appreciate it. Thank you very much. Have a good night.
