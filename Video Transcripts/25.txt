- Boston!
48:20
Oh!
48:21
Guys, I'm excited.
48:24
(audience cheers)
48:31
And now I'm scared.
48:32
All right.
48:33
So, guys, get this,
48:34
a couple weeks ago I started using whitening strips
48:37
and I asked my boyfriend if they were working
48:39
and he looked at me and he said,
48:40
"Nah, you still look Mexican."
48:42
(audience laughs)
48:44
All right.
48:45
Got it.
48:46
You notice that they're putting security alarms
48:48
on the whitening strips so that people don't steal them now?
48:51
Like, people are stealing whitening strips.
48:53
It's gotta be a high crime, beautiful smile neighborhood.
48:56
You know?
48:57
Like, why would you wanna do that?
48:58
Why would you wanna make yourself stand out
49:00
in a police lineup, you know?
49:01
Like, "Do you see the guy that mugged you?"
49:04
(imitates sobbing)
49:05
The guy with the gorgeous smile, number three, you know?
49:09
My name's Cristela.
49:11
You guys can call me Chris.
49:12
That's my nickname.
49:13
Nicknames are cool.
49:14
It's like, your friends are saying,
49:15
"Hey, you have a crappy name.
49:18
Don't worry, we'll fix it for you."
49:20
(audience laughs)
49:22
Girls are very cute at giving each other nicknames.
49:24
We're very adorable, you know?
49:25
It's like, "Hi, I'm Michelle."
49:26
"No, you're not, you're Mickey." (giggles)
49:29
(audience laughs)
49:30
Guys are total dicks with each other though.
49:32
You guys will give each other nicknames to things
49:35
that suck about that guy, you know?
49:37
"Hey, my name's Michael."
49:38
"What's up, sweat stains?"
49:40
(audience laughs)
49:41
"Come on, hang out.
49:43
Meet my buddies, diabetes and long balls.
49:45
What's up, yo?" (audience laughs)
49:52
I like having a name like Cristela though,
49:53
'cause you always know when you're talking
49:54
about me 'cause it's different, you know?
49:56
I feel bad for people that have really common names,
49:58
like Jennifer.
49:59
Jennifer's a great name, but I know like 12 of them,
50:01
you know?
50:02
When you have a name like Jennifer,
50:03
you gotta take care of yourself,
50:05
'cause people are gonna start using words to describe you.
50:08
You want the good words like pretty, funny, smart.
50:10
You don't want the bad words like,
50:11
"Hey, you know Jennifer?"
50:12
"Which one?"
50:13
"Mustache Jennifer."
50:14
(audience laughs)
50:16
"She's Fat Tina's little sister."
50:17
"Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, they're good people, good people."
50:23
I'm excited to be here.
50:24
I hope you guys believe me, I mean it.
50:25
You can always tell when I'm lying
50:28
because I don't lie very well.
50:31
Like, it always comes up with, like, friend intros.
50:33
You can always tell how much I like you
50:34
by the way I introduce you to friends.
50:36
The more I like you, the better intro I give you, you know?
50:38
Like, "This is John, John's a lawyer, good looking.
50:42
I love this guy!
50:43
Oh my god, I would take a bullet for you.
50:46
And, John, this is Mary."
50:48
(audience laughs)
50:55
"She's a whore."
50:56
(audience laughs)
50:59
I don't know if you have this,
51:00
but I have this one friend on Facebook that does nothing
51:02
but talk about how many haters she's got.
51:04
It's all she does all day long.
51:06
It's always the same thing.
51:08
"Haters gonna hate, whatever.
51:11
I don't know why got haters, haters gonna hate, whatever."
51:15
I always wanna be like, "Well maybe you're a bitch."
51:17
(audience laughs)
51:18
Like, think about it.
51:19
People only talk bad about bad people, you know?
51:21
People never get together
51:23
and talk bad about someone good, you know?
51:25
It's like, "You know why hate Teresa?
51:27
That bitch is always volunteering for Special Olympics.
51:30
She's always feeding the homeless.
51:33
Who the hell does she think she is?"
51:35
(audience laughs)
51:37
You ever notice that when you hate someone
51:39
everything they do just pisses you off?
51:40
"Look at that bitch eating chicken."
51:42
(audience laughs)
51:45
"Why you eating chicken, bitch?"
51:47
(audience laughs)
51:49
I like your hoodie.
51:51
Have you ever noticed girls love getting compliments
51:53
on what we're wearing?
51:54
It's not that we think we look good.
51:56
We just wanna tell you how much that thing costs, you know?
51:58
"Hey, I like your dress."
51:59
"$8." (audience laughs)
52:02
Then it becomes a competition to see who spent less money,
52:05
you know?
52:06
"Hey, I like your jeans."
52:07
"Two bucks, Goodwill." (audience laughs)
52:09
"Hey, I like your shirt."
52:10
"Ah, screw it, I found on the street.
52:12
I win, bitch!" (audience laughs)
52:18
I almost didn't make it here tonight.
52:20
I was in my room watching my favorite show,
52:22
"16 and Pregnant," I love this show.
52:26
Because I love when bad things happen to bad people.
52:28
Oh my God!
52:30
If you guys think your life sucks, watch this show.
52:32
You'll feel so much better about yourself,
52:35
'cause these girls are so bitchy you just wanna hate them,
52:37
you know?
52:38
"Whatever, I'm pregnant. (groans)
52:40
Whatever a baby's just like a puppy." (groans)
52:44
And the moment they go into labor, like, "Oh my God."
52:47
(Cristela laughs) (audience laughs)
52:50
It hurts, right?
52:52
Oh, I hope you have twins.
52:56
(lips smacking) I love it.
53:03
Fun fact, when I was a kid,
53:05
I used to think Rosetta Stone was the name
53:07
of a sassy black woman
53:11
that knew every language in the world.
53:13
(speaking in foreign language), suckers,
53:14
now y'all know French. (audience laughs)
53:17
Rosetta. (audience laughs)
53:19
So sassy.
53:24
By the way, standup is my part-time job.
53:26
My full-time job is being the token ethnic friend
53:29
to white people. (audience laughs)
53:31
White people, oh, they love having that ethnic friend.
53:34
They get excited.
53:35
They talk about us like we're the new iPad, you know?
53:37
"Have you gotten one yet? (laughs)
53:40
Oh man, you need a upgrade.
53:41
I got rid of the Eskimo, this is Mexican."
53:44
(audience applauds)
53:46
I do shows all over the country,
53:48
and there's parts where like there's no Latinos everywhere.
53:51
You know?
53:52
So it's in these areas where people
53:53
come up to me after the shows
53:55
and they wanna introduce me to the other ethnic friend
53:58
they have, you know?
53:59
I was doing a show in Nebraska.
54:00
This woman comes up to me and she's like,
54:02
"Hey, hi, hmm.
54:04
Um, so I was wondering
54:08
if you wanted to meet my Spanish friend."
54:11
(audience laughs)
54:14
"Okay, did they come to the show?"
54:17
"No, I just thought that you might know each other."
54:22
You can't even get mad at them 'cause it's not their fault
54:24
they're totally ignorant, you know?
54:27
I was like, "Look, woman,
54:28
there's millions of us out there
54:30
and we don't all know each other, all right?
54:32
Thank you."
54:33
- [Audience Member] Woo.
54:36
- So I go and meet her friend,
54:40
and we know each other. (audience laughs)
54:44
She went to school with my brother and I was like,
54:46
"Dammit, white woman, you were right,
54:48
we do all know each other."
54:51
Who knew?
54:53
I'm originally from Texas.
54:54
I live in L.A. now. (audience cheers)
54:57
Thank you.
54:58
You guys own maps. (audience laughs)
55:02
And so it gets hard sometimes
55:03
because I don't have any family in L.A so I get homesick.
55:07
The good thing about living in L.A.
55:08
is that there's a lot of Mexicans there,
55:10
so whenever I get homesick,
55:12
all I have to do is go down a Home Depot,
55:15
and hire a day laborer to be my relative for the day.
55:19
'Cause then he gets money for the day
55:20
and I get a brother you know?
55:23
"This is Jose, he does dry wall.
55:26
He'll be playing my brother who is also named Jose,
55:30
and also does dry wall." (laughs)
55:32
(audience laughs)
55:37
I babysat my friend's eight-year-old daughter last week.
55:40
Adorable girl.
55:41
She invited me to her tea party.
55:43
And I went into the bedroom, she had a sign that said,
55:45
"Go back to Mexico."
55:46
I was like, "Damn, these tea parties have changed
55:49
since I was a kid."
55:52
And think about it, we're at a point right now
55:54
where it's very hard to be Latino.
55:56
People are very critical of us, you know?
55:58
I get it, you know?
55:59
There's parts in the country they don't have any Latinos.
56:01
That's where, they're like the worst, you know?
56:03
Did a show show in Iowa.
56:04
I was walking to the venue.
56:06
This old man yells at me, "Mexicans are lazy."
56:09
I'm like, "Damn.
56:11
Should I be walking faster?"
56:13
(chuckling) (audience laughing)
56:18
I don't know, right?
56:20
Keeps yelling at me, "Mexicans are lazy.
56:22
Mexicans are taking away our jobs."
56:24
I'm like, "Well, which one is it?"
56:26
(audience laughs)
56:28
"Are we lazy or are we taking away you jobs?"
56:31
Just put 'em both together and that doesn't make any sense.
56:34
You know?
56:34
"Jose took my job and now he's napping."
56:38
Well you were a crappy worker.
56:39
I don't even.
56:41
I'm American, you know, I was born here.
56:43
And sometimes when I think of the things
56:45
we have available in this country
56:46
I'm not surprised that other countries hate us.
56:48
Think about it.
56:49
We have a store called, Build-A-Bear.
56:51
(audience laughs)
56:52
We have a store where we paint them to let us build a toy
56:55
and pretend we work at a sweat shop.
56:57
(audience laughs)
56:59
You been in that store?
57:02
There's moms everywhere,
57:03
"Happy birthday, Megan, you're Chinese for the day."
57:06
(audience laughs)
57:10
Can you imagine showing that store
57:12
to someone that works in a sweat shop?
57:13
"What the hell is this?"
57:16
I wish I could explain,
57:17
but I've gotta go to Subway
57:18
and have three people make me one sandwich.
57:20
(audience laughs)
57:30
I need to lose weight.
57:31
I think most of us think we do.
57:32
We could all drop a couple pounds, you know?
57:34
I mean, you know, it's weird.
57:35
We always say the same thing.
57:36
"I'm gonna start on Monday."
57:39
That Monday never comes.
57:40
Monday comes, I eat a donut, I'm like, "Dammit!"
57:44
My boyfriend's like, "Well just start tomorrow."
57:46
I'm like, "I can't start tomorrow.
57:48
No one starts on Tuesday.
57:51
I gotta wait till next Monday."
57:53
(audience laughs)
57:54
I just realized I needed to lose weight,
57:56
'cause I noticed I don't even use a calendar
57:58
to keep track of the year, I use food.
58:01
Like when the McRib is out, I know it's November.
58:04
(audience laughs)
58:07
A friend tried to tell me
58:08
she was getting married in January.
58:09
I'm like, "Oh, Girl Scout cookies, yeah.
58:12
Mm, yeah, I'm there."
58:16
I just started this diet
58:18
where you have to learn portion sizes, which sucks,
58:21
'cause then you realize how bad
58:22
you've been eating your entire life.
58:24
Guys, I just found out a pint of ice cream is four servings.
58:33
It's a sad day when you realize you've been eating
58:37
for a family of four your entire life.
58:40
(audience laughs)
58:47
You ever notice that no one ever tells you
58:48
that you're fat until you lose the weight?
58:50
That's messed up. (audience laughs)
58:52
You lose a couple pounds,
58:54
you won't see your friends for months,
58:55
the first thing outta their mouth is,
58:56
"Oh my God, you lost weight.
58:58
Girl, you were fat." (audience laughs)
59:03
It's a backhanded compliment.
59:05
That's the only time you'll hear that too, you know?
59:07
You'll never hear that any other time in your life.
59:09
You'll never be like, "Wow, you got married?
59:12
You were a whore."
59:13
(audience laughs)
59:14
"You slept with everyone.
59:15
Oh my, is that your husband?
59:17
You must be good, 'cause she sampled the neighborhood."
59:19
(audience laughs)
59:27
I've been trying to eat healthier though,
59:28
so I'm eating the salads at the fast food places.
59:30
You know, I love it.
59:32
I like when fast food tries to be healthy
59:33
'cause they never get it right.
59:35
They'll have a salad that sounds like a good idea.
59:36
But then they'll add that one ingredient
59:38
that messes it all up, you know?
59:40
It's like, "Hey you wanna try your new salad?
59:42
We got fresh lettuce, fresh tomatoes, fresh cucumbers,
59:45
topped with hot fudge.
59:48
The Mcfudge salad." (audience laughs)
59:50
That's disgusting.
59:53
I hate tomatoes. (audience laughs)
59:55
Get rid of that.
59:58
It's weird though, 'cause we'll always add junk food
1:00:00
to health food to make it taste better,
1:00:02
but we never add health food to junk food.
1:00:04
Close as we get? Carrot cake.
1:00:06
(audience laughs)
1:00:07
But even then the carrot
1:00:08
that comes with it is made outta frosting at the top.
1:00:11
I say, screw it, that counts as a vegetable. (laughs)
1:00:15
Can I have your carrot? (laughs)
1:00:17
Oh my God, I'm like a vegetarian.
1:00:19
(audience laughs)
1:00:26
- Do I have any pot smokers here at all?
1:00:28
- [Audience] Woo!
1:00:31
- Oh, geez was this a group outing?
1:00:34
My God.
1:00:35
(audience laughing)
1:00:37
I have a theory. I don't smoke weed. I have a theory.
1:00:39
If your life sucks, don't smoke weed.
1:00:41
'Cause when I was in college, I got high one time
1:00:43
and when I got high, everything slowed down.
1:00:45
(audience laughing)
1:00:46
The last thing you need when your life sucks
1:00:49
is to put that sucker in slow motion.
1:00:51
(audience laughing)
1:00:52
'Cause when you're sober and you're unemployed,
1:00:54
you're unemployed,
1:00:55
but when you're high and you're unemployed,
1:00:56
you are un-
1:00:58
em-
1:01:00
ployed.
1:01:02
(audience cheering)
1:01:03
I say if your life sucks, drink,
1:01:05
because if you drink, you might black out
1:01:06
and that's like a fast forward button.
1:01:08
That's what you want.
1:01:09
(audience laughing)
1:01:14
I like when I drink and black out,
1:01:16
'cause the next day I always feel like
1:01:17
I'm in my own "CSI" episode you know?
1:01:19
(audience laughing)
1:01:20
Looking for clues everywhere I go.
1:01:22
What the...
1:01:25
Oh,
1:01:26
it's Taco Bell,
1:01:29
Mountain Dew.
1:01:32
Who the hell is that?
1:01:34
(audience laughing)
1:01:38
When I was younger though, when I turned 21, I was stupid.
1:01:41
I got a DUI, that sucked. Got to the part of the test
1:01:44
where they're like, "Walk in a straight line."
1:01:46
I was like, "Not tonight.
1:01:48
Shoulda caught me last night, I was sober."
1:01:50
(audience laughing)
1:01:51
It's at that part of the test though
1:01:52
where I wished I was a gymnast.
1:01:54
'Cause I don't think a gymnast has ever gotten a DUI
1:01:56
'cause these chicks have balance.
1:01:58
Like no matter how drunk they are,
1:01:59
they can always walk that straight line, you know?
1:02:01
"Yeah, officer, sure I can walk a straight line.
1:02:06
No problem.
1:02:08
(audience laughing)
1:02:14
(audience cheering)
1:02:21
Tada!"
1:02:24
"Wow. Here are your keys."
1:02:27
That was the dumbest thing I've ever done.
1:02:29
I'm a very responsible person.
1:02:31
Like when I have sex, I have safe sex.
1:02:33
When I have sex, I wear a helmet,
1:02:36
(audience laughing)
1:02:37
I set up traffic cones,
1:02:38
I direct traffic, "Here."
1:02:39
Very safe, very safe.
1:02:45
I have a boyfriend. We've been together for years.
1:02:47
When we first started dating he asked me that question.
1:02:50
How many guys have you slept with?
1:02:54
And I said three.
1:02:56
- [Audience Member] Liar!
1:02:57
- No, it's true, I've only slept with three.
1:02:59
I don't know how many I've (beep)
1:03:01
(audience laughing)
1:03:02
but...
1:03:03
(audience cheering)
1:03:10
I've only slept with three.
1:03:11
(laughing)
1:03:13
Ask the right question, stupid.
1:03:14
(audience cheering)
1:03:16
(laughing)
1:03:21
Technicality.
1:03:25
I do have a white boyfriend.
1:03:26
I don't mean to brag, but...
1:03:28
(audience laughing)
1:03:29
I love it.
1:03:30
Oh, I love having a white boyfriend.
1:03:31
He makes me feel like I'm white by association, man.
1:03:34
I get pulled over by a cop,
1:03:35
I just point to the passenger seat.
1:03:37
I'm like, "I think I'm getting a warning."
1:03:39
(audience laughing)
1:03:41
I love it!
1:03:43
He's been teaching me to do white things
1:03:45
I didn't know were possible,
1:03:46
like talk to a supervisor when things are unsatisfactory.
1:03:49
(audience laughing)
1:03:50
I didn't know you could do that, man.
1:03:53
Brown people don't do that.
1:03:55
We went to eat a burger. The burger sucked. He complained.
1:03:57
Two weeks later, gift card at my apartment.
1:04:00
White people, you don't understand.
1:04:01
To me, you're like superheroes.
1:04:03
You can do things (audience cheering)
1:04:04
I can't do.
1:04:05
White guy, the power to walk through Nordstrom
1:04:07
without being followed by security.
1:04:10
I love it. (audience laughing)
1:04:12
You guys are awesome.
1:04:18
I'm a tomboy.
1:04:19
I grew up with brothers, you know.
1:04:20
I'm not very girly.
1:04:22
I love being a tomboy though.
1:04:24
My favorite thing to do on the weekends is go outside
1:04:26
and watch the girls that are wearing like the tight clothes,
1:04:30
like the high heels, walking around, you know,
1:04:32
trying to look sexy.
1:04:33
It's like, they're saying, "Oh yeah.
1:04:36
(audience laughing)
1:04:37
Come and get it."
1:04:39
(audience laughing)
1:04:41
Worst time of the year just passed months ago.
1:04:43
Halloween. That's the worst time, you know?
1:04:45
- [Audience Member] Whoo!
1:04:46
- 'Cause the girls dress
1:04:47
up in like the little costumes, you know?
1:04:48
It's like, "Mmm. I'm a sexy French maid. Ooh."
1:04:53
(audience cheering)
1:04:54
Like I can't do that.
1:04:56
I'd just look like a maid.
1:04:58
(audience laughing)
1:05:03
"Housekeeping."
1:05:05
(audience laughing)
1:05:07
That's the last thing I need
1:05:08
for me to try to turn my boyfriend on.
1:05:09
He's like, "Look who's doing some cleaning.
1:05:11
All right. Here's my laundry."
1:05:13
(audience laughing)
1:05:16
I hate Halloween, you know.
1:05:17
My favorite day is the day after Halloween
1:05:20
'cause that's when you see all those sexy girls
1:05:21
in the costumes doing the walk of shame back home.
1:05:24
I love it.
1:05:25
'Cause the sexy kitten isn't sexy anymore,
1:05:28
you know, she's got a broken ear.
1:05:29
(audience laughing)
1:05:30
The sexy button- the bunny is missing a tail.
1:05:33
(audience laughing)
1:05:34
They look like the abused pet commercials
1:05:35
from the Sarah McLaughlin, you know, like.
1:05:37
(singing sustained note)
1:05:42
(audience cheering)
1:05:44
"This sexy cat lost its tail, banging a pirate," you know?
1:05:48
(audience laughing)
1:05:56
- [Audience Member] Ahhh...
1:05:58
I'm Latina, you know,.
1:05:59
I realize that the older I get there's cer-
1:06:01
- [Audience Members] Wahhh!
1:06:02
- Yeah?
1:06:03
(audience members cheering)
1:06:04
- We got Latinas?
1:06:05
(audience members cheering)
1:06:08
In the back and in the balcony. Ah.
1:06:10
(audience laughing)
1:06:11
Look at that.
1:06:13
"Not 'cause we got here late."
1:06:15
(audience laughing)
1:06:17
(laughing)
1:06:21
Hey, I'm Latino, you know?
1:06:22
And I realize that the older I get
1:06:24
there's certain things I can't do
1:06:25
because they're stereotypes and it doesn't look right,
1:06:27
you know?
1:06:28
Couple years ago, I date a white guy.
1:06:30
On our fourth date,
1:06:31
he's like, "Hey, this weekend,
1:06:32
let's drive upstate,
1:06:34
go pick some apples.
1:06:36
It'll be nice."
1:06:37
(audience laughing)
1:06:43
(audience laughing)
1:06:53
What?
1:06:54
(audience laughing)
1:06:55
"Yeah, this weekend we'll drive upstate.
1:06:56
We'll go pick some apples.
1:06:58
It'll be romantic."
1:06:59
Like what? No!
1:07:01
Two white people picking apples, that's romantic.
1:07:03
Me, I'm a migrant farm worker.
1:07:05
Do you understand that?
1:07:06
(audience laughing)
1:07:07
Like I would be afraid that they would let him go
1:07:09
but I'd have to stay to meet my quota for the day.
1:07:11
(audience laughing)
1:07:15
I'll see you at dinner.
1:07:16
(audience laughing)
1:07:20
I am a tomboy.
1:07:21
There's certain things I like to do
1:07:22
that are kind of girly though.
1:07:23
Like I like love songs.
1:07:25
I love love songs.
1:07:26
Most women love love songs.
1:07:29
Here's the thing, guys, you don't know this
1:07:31
but when we date you,
1:07:34
we pick a song
1:07:36
(audience laughing)
1:07:37
that reminds us of you.
1:07:40
And that's our song.
1:07:43
You don't know it's our song, but that is our song.
1:07:47
And we'll play this song all day long while we're with you.
1:07:50
We'll be driving down the street.
1:07:53
♪ How am I supposed to live without you? ♪
1:07:58
(audience laughing)
1:08:02
I don't know!
1:08:04
(audience laughing)
1:08:06
Then a week later you dump us.
1:08:09
You know what we do?
1:08:11
We listen to the same song over and do over again,
1:08:14
only now we're bitter.
1:08:16
Now we play this song to remind us what a dick you were.
1:08:19
It's no longer a love song.
1:08:21
Now it's revenge and we want you dead.
1:08:23
(audience members cheering)
1:08:24
We'll lock ourselves in the bedroom, put it on high volume,
1:08:27
and now the song takes on a completely different meaning.
1:08:30
Now we're like,
1:08:33
"How am I suppo..."
1:08:37
(audience laughing)
1:08:43
"How am I suppo..."
1:08:48
(audience cheering)
1:08:49
Ahhh!
1:08:52
Ahhh!
1:08:55
Screw you!
1:08:57
I don't need you!
1:09:00
I'm defriending you on Facebook!
1:09:02
(audience laughing)
1:09:05
(fake crying)
1:09:11
Relationship status,
1:09:13
(audience laughing)
1:09:15
"It's complicated!"
1:09:17
(audience applauding)
1:09:22
(laughing)
1:09:25
Ahhh!
1:09:27
It's not part of the joke guys.
1:09:28
I'm tired.
1:09:29
(audience laughing)
1:09:32
Just needed a break.
1:09:34
(audience laughing)
1:09:38
Hey, there.
1:09:39
(audience laughing)
1:09:40
If I had a calendar this would be February.
1:09:42
(audience laughing)
1:09:44
I do like a lot of music.
1:09:46
I can't get into half of rap nowadays, you know?
1:09:49
Half of rap sucks, you know?
1:09:50
'Cause it's always the same thing.
1:09:51
Like rap songs, all the guys wanna do is brag
1:09:55
about all the cool stuff they own.
1:09:56
You know, "I got a Bentley. I got a Ferrari."
1:09:59
Who cares?
1:10:01
If I was a burglar though,
1:10:03
(audience laughing)
1:10:04
I would do nothing
1:10:05
but listen to rap music all day long,
1:10:07
see who has the best stuff and take that guy's crap,
1:10:09
you know? Like, "Whoa, Jay-Z's got a Bentley?
1:10:11
Hell yeah, I want it.
1:10:12
Stealing his house tomorrow, yeah."
1:10:14
All rap songs are the same.
1:10:16
It's always a guy promising women
1:10:19
expensive things they can't afford, you know?
1:10:21
Like, "Yo, yo, Louis Viton, Chanel, diamond rings,
1:10:24
bling, bling, hollah,"
1:10:27
It's like, damn. You think, I mean really,
1:10:29
do you think I want diamond rings?
1:10:31
I mean really, you know? We're in a recession.
1:10:33
(audience laughing)
1:10:34
I need to pay my cable bill.
1:10:36
(audience laughing)
1:10:38
I mean, if rappers could lower their standards
1:10:39
and promise me everyday things I could use
1:10:41
you better believe I would be the first woman
1:10:43
in line to take 'em up on their offer.
1:10:46
Jay-Z would be up on stage like,
1:10:47
"Yo, yo, I'll buy you a tank of gas."
1:10:49
(audience laughing)
1:10:54
"Jay-Z!
1:10:56
I'll sleep with you for a tank o' gas.
1:10:58
(audience laughing)
1:10:59
It doesn't even have to be premium.
1:11:01
(audience laughing)
1:11:02
I just needa go home."
1:11:04
(audience laughing)
1:11:06
Gas is expensive.
1:11:09
I am a tomboy.
1:11:10
There's certain things I like to do
1:11:12
that are kind of girly though.
1:11:14
Like I like getting my nails done.
1:11:16
Here's the thing though,
1:11:17
I hate small talk.
1:11:18
(audience laughing)
1:11:20
And the women at the nail salon,
1:11:21
that's all they do.
1:11:22
They ask you these questions,
1:11:23
they don't care about the answer.
1:11:25
I get it.
1:11:26
They're trying to kill time.
1:11:26
I get it, right.
1:11:27
I was at a nail salon, this woman's doing my nails.
1:11:30
And she's like, "Oh, are you from India?"
1:11:33
(audience laughing)
1:11:36
Okay?
1:11:37
(audience laughing)
1:11:39
I've got two choices.
1:11:40
I can lie and say that I'm from India
1:11:42
and hope she shuts up or I could be like,
1:11:45
"No, I'm Mexican, blah, blah, blah."
1:11:47
So I was like,
1:11:50
"I'm Indian,"
1:11:52
(audience laughing)
1:11:53
thinking, "That's it right?"
1:11:54
Like, "Oh what part of India?"
1:11:57
(audience laughing)
1:12:00
Uh...
1:12:03
Uh...
1:12:08
"Guatemala?" I have...
1:12:10
(audience laughing)
1:12:11
Uh...
1:12:13
"What's the weather like in India?"
1:12:14
I'm like, "Oh my God, I don't know.
1:12:16
I'm lying, all right?"
1:12:18
So I'm thinking, screw it.
1:12:19
I'm gonna lie.
1:12:20
I'm gonna leave.
1:12:21
I'm never gonna see her again, right?
1:12:22
So I'm like, "It's snowing in India."
1:12:24
No clue, right?
1:12:25
(audience laughing)
1:12:26
So I leave, thinking I'm never gonna see her again.
1:12:28
Guess what?
1:12:30
She does amazing nails.
1:12:32
(audience laughing)
1:12:36
So I have to go back to her.
1:12:38
(audience laughing)
1:12:40
So for the next six months, every time I go,
1:12:43
I have to study
1:12:45
(audience laughing)
1:12:47
one to two hours on India,
1:12:50
(audience laughing)
1:12:51
because the questions are getting harder
1:12:54
and harder and harder. (audience laughing)
1:12:58
Finally, after six months she's like,
1:12:59
"Ooh, what's the major export of India?"
1:13:01
(audience laughing)
1:13:05
"I don't know!
1:13:06
(audience laughing)
1:13:07
Look, I can't do this anymore, okay!
1:13:09
I'm not Indian.
1:13:09
I'm Mexican.
1:13:11
I'm Mexican!"
1:13:12
(audience laughing)
1:13:13
She's like, "Oh honey, I know you're Mexican.
1:13:15
You pay with debit card.
1:13:15
I'm just messing with you."
1:13:17
(audience laughing)
1:13:18
Thank you guys! My name is Cristela Alonzo.
1:13:19
Thank you so much!
1:13:20
(audience cheering)
1:13:21
Thank you! Oh, thank you guys!
1:13:25
Thank you!
1:13:26
(upbeat electronic music)
1:13:28
Thanks!
