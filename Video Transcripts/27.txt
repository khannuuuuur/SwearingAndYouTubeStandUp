SO, THIS MIDGET -- YOU'LL SEE WHY --

1:31
SO, LIKE, I DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING, BUT THE WHOLE TIME IN MY HEAD,
1:34
THE WHOLE TIME, I'M THINKING LIKE,
1:36
"HOW DO I GET THIS MIDGET TO CALL ME A [BLEEP]
1:38
SO I CAN CALL HIM A MIDGET?"
1:40
[ LAUGHTER ]
1:48
YOU KNOW?
1:50
'CAUSE WHEN YOU GET CALLED THE "N" WORD AS A BLACK PERSON,
1:52
YOU CAN DO ANYTHING.
1:54
IT'S LIKE GETTING A GOLD STAR ON "SUPER MARIO BROS." AND JUNK.
1:57

"OH, YES, OBAMA, OBAMA, YES."
2:14
[ LAUGHTER ]
2:16
I JUST STARTED KIND OF DOING THIS STAND-UP THING, RIGHT?
2:22
SO, LIKE, YOU KNOW,
2:23
I USED TO WRITE FOR THIS SHOW CALLED "30 ROCK."
2:25
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
2:26
THAT'S WHAT'S UP, RIGHT?
2:29
AND I LOVE WRITING, BUT WHEN I STARTED DOING STAND-UP,
2:33
I WAS LIKE, "I DON'T REALLY KNOW WHAT I'M DOING.
2:35
I'M GONNA TALK TO TRACY ABOUT IT."
2:37
I WAS GONNA ASK TRACY WHAT --
2:38
"DO YOU HAVE ANY TIPS FOR ME, 'CAUSE I'M JUST STARTING.
2:40
DO YOU HAVE ANY TIPS?"
2:41
AND HE WAS LIKE [ As Tracy Morgan ] "YEAH, MAN,
2:43
TALK ABOUT PENISES, MAN."
2:44
[ LAUGHTER ]
2:50
[ Normal voice ] I WAS LIKE, "WHAT?"
2:51
HE WAS LIKE [ As Tracy Morgan ] "YEAH, MAN, TALK ABOUT PENISES.
2:54
"DUDES LOVE THAT [BLEEP] MAN.
2:57

2:58
"I'LL TELL YOU A STORY, MAN.
3:00
"ONE TIME I HAD BROKEN INTO THIS ASIAN GIRL'S DORM ROOM
3:03
AT RUTGERS UNIVERSITY."
3:05
[ LAUGHTER ]
3:10
"AND I FELL ASLEEP.
3:12
"AND THEY WOKE ME UP AND THEY SAID,
3:14
"'TRACY, YOU SUPPOSED TO BE ON IN FIVE MINUTES.'
3:16
"AND I DIDN'T HAVE NO MATERIAL.
3:19
"SO I JUST SAID [BLEEP] FOR 45 MINUTES.
3:23
"I TALKED ABOUT PENISES FOR 45 MINUTES.
3:26
DO THAT. DO THAT, MAN."
3:29
[ Normal voice ] SO I DID THAT.
3:30
YOU KNOW, I DIDN'T KNOW ANYTHING.
3:32
I WAS LIKE, "OKAY, IT'S TRACY MORGAN.
3:33
I'M GONNA LISTEN TO HIM." SO I DID THAT.
3:35
I TALKED ABOUT PENISES, AND PEOPLE LOVED IT.
3:37
IT WAS GOOD. IT WENT WELL.
3:38
AND THEN, AFTERWARDS, A DUDE WAS LIKE,
3:39
"HEY, CHRIS WANTS TO TALK TO YOU."
3:40
I WAS LIKE, "WHO?"
3:42
"CHRIS ROCK WANTS TO TALK TO YOU."
3:43
I WAS LIKE, "WHAT?! CHRIS ROCK?!"
3:44
I LOVE CHRIS ROCK. CHRIS ROCK'S MY IDOL, RIGHT?
3:47
SO I'M LIKE, "YEAH." I GO UP TO HIM.
3:48

3:50
"YO, WHAT'D YOU THINK?"
3:51

[ Normal voice ] AND HE RIPPED INTO ME, MAN.
4:12
HE RIPPED INTO ME, AND THAT BROKE MY HEART,
4:14
'CAUSE I LOVE CHRIS ROCK.
4:16
I USED TO DO HIS BITS ALL THE TIME.
4:17
HE HAS A FAMOUS BIT CALLED,
4:19
YOU KNOW, "'N' WORD VERSUS BLACK PEOPLE."
4:21
AND I LOVE THAT BIT,
4:23
BUT I WASN'T ALLOWED TO SAY THE "N" WORD IN THE HOUSE.
4:25
MY PARENTS WOULDN'T LET ME SAY THE "N" WORD,
4:27
SO I JUST DID "BLACK PEOPLE VERSUS VAMPIRES" INSTEAD.
4:31
I WAS UP THERE, YOU KNOW, TELLING JOKES.
4:32
I WAS LIKE, [ As Chris Rock ] "THERE'S TWO CATS.
4:34
"TWO CATS GOIN' ON.
4:35
"THERE'S BLACK PEOPLE AND VAMPIRES.
4:40
"THE VAMPIRES GOT TO GO.
4:42
"EVERY TIME BLACK PEOPLE WANT TO HAVE A GOOD TIME,
4:45
"IGNORANT-ASS VAMPIRES GOT TO RUIN IT FOR EVERYBODY.
4:48
"CAN'T KEEP A BLOOD BANK OPEN. GRAND OPENING?
4:51
"YOU WANT TO KNOW THE WORST THING ABOUT VAMPIRES?
4:54
"THE WORST THING ABOUT VAMPIRES --
4:56
"VAMPIRES CAN'T BE IN THE SUN, BOY.
4:58
YOU CAN'T HAVE NO VAMPIRE FRIEND AND THEN TAKE HIM TO THE BEACH."
5:02
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
5:13
[ Normal voice ] I GOT PRETTY GOOD AT IT. I GOT PRETTY GOOD AT IT.
5:16
[ CHUCKLES ]
5:17
YOU KNOW, YEAH, I JUST -- I DIDN'T SAY THE "N" WORD.
5:20
I WASN'T ALLOWED.
5:21
I DIDN'T START SAYING IT UNTIL LIKE 11th GRADE, RIGHT?
5:23
THAT'S WHEN I DECIDED TO SAY THE "N" WORD,
5:26
AND BY THEN, YOU MISS YOUR "N" WORD MOTOR SKILLS.
5:28
YOU CAN'T SAY IT RIGHT.
5:29
LIKE, I WOULD WALK DOWN THE HALL
5:31
AND PEOPLE WERE LIKE, "HEY, WHAT'S UP, MAN?"
5:33
I'M LIKE, "HEY, WHAT'S UP [BLEEP]"
5:34
AND THEY BE LIKE, "AAH, AAH. I KNOW YOU'RE BLACK, BUT, MNH."
5:38
OH, IT'S THAT HARD 'R', MAN.
5:42
YOU KNOW?
5:44
SOME PEOPLE CAN'T SAY THE "N" WORD.
5:47
SOME BLACK PEOPLE CANNOT SAY IT. IT'S TRUE.
5:49
CAN YOU IMAGINE SEAL SAYING THE "N" WORD?
5:52
[ LAUGHTER ]
5:53
NO, RIGHT?
5:54
YOU CAN'T HAVE SEAL AT THE GRAMMYS TALKING ABOUT...

6:02
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
6:04
NO.
6:06
YOU CAN'T HAVE THAT.
6:08
YOU CAN'T HAVE, LIKE, OBAMA UP THERE JUST TALKING
6:10
AND JUST, LIKE, GIVING A PRESS CONFERENCE
6:13
OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT
6:14
AND JUST HAVE IT TURN INTO DEF COMEDY JAM OR SOMETHING.
6:16
HE'S LIKE, [ As Barack Obama ] "AS WE STAND HERE TODAY..."
6:19
[ LAUGHTER ]
6:21
"...THERE ARE STILL SOME AMERICANS
6:23
WHO DON'T BELIEVE I HAVE THEIR BEST INTEREST AT HEART."
6:26
[ LAUGHTER ]
6:30
"AND I'D LIKE TO PUT THOSE FEARS TO REST TODAY.
6:35
"BUT BEFORE I DO THAT...
6:38
I'D LIKE TO TALK ABOUT HOW [BLEEP] BE TRIPPIN'."
6:41
[ LAUGHTER ]
6:43
"'CAUSE THEY DO."
6:45
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
6:47
"THEY BE TRIPPIN'.
6:49
"[BLEEP] BE TRIPPIN' --
6:50
"ESPECIALLY WHEN BITCHES BE AROUND.
6:53
"BECAUSE BITCHES BE WANTIN' TO GO TO THE CHEESECAKE FACTORY.
6:57
"AND THEY BE GETTIN' THEIR CHEESECAKE
7:00
"WITH BLUEBERRIES, STRAWBERRIES, AND CARAMELS.
7:03
AND I BE LIKE, 'BITCH, THAT IS EXPENSIVE.'"
7:05
[ LAUGHTER ]
7:09
WHEN OBAMA GOT ELECTED, I WAS SO EXCITED.
7:11
IT WAS AWESOME.
7:12
I REMEMBER I WORE AN OBAMA SHIRT, RIGHT?
7:14
I WORE AN OBAMA SHIRT THE DAY HE GOT ELECTED.
7:16
I WAS EXPECTING HIGH-FIVE CITY, YOU KNOW?
7:19
NOBODY DID ANYTHING.
7:21
NOTHING.
7:23
I KIND OF REALIZED IT'S KIND OF REDUNDANT
7:25
TO HAVE A BLACK DUDE WEARING AN OBAMA SHIRT.
7:27
EVERYBODY'S LIKE, "YEAH, WE KNOW."
7:28
[ LAUGHTER ]
7:30
"YOU LIKE OBAMA. WE GET IT."
7:32
'CAUSE IT'S LIKE, YOU KNOW, I DO THE SAME THING.
7:34
I REALIZED -- IT'S LIKE, "YEAH, IT'S KIND OF REDUNDANT."
7:36
I DON'T GO UP TO WHITE PEOPLE WEARING COLDPLAY SHIRTS LIKE,
7:38
"YOU LIKE COLDPLAY?
7:40
"HUH. FOR HOW LONG?
7:44
FOREVER?"
7:49
THE ONE THING I DIDN'T GET ABOUT OBAMA
7:51
THAT KIND OF MADE ME MAD WAS, LIKE,
7:53
WHEN HE WAS COMING UP, PEOPLE WERE LIKE,
7:55
"WE HAVE A SERIOUS BLACK CANDIDATE FOR PRESIDENT."
7:57
THIS IS CRAZY.
7:58
"WE HAVE A SERIOUS BLACK CANDIDATE."
8:00
AND THEN WHEN HE WON, THEY WERE LIKE,
8:02
"OH, OUR FIRST MULTIRACIAL PRESIDENT."
8:04
AND I WAS LIKE, "THAT'S NOT FAIR."
8:05
I MEAN, LIKE, LET'S SET THE RECORD STRAIGHT, OKAY?
8:07
IF YOU WENT OUTSIDE TONIGHT AFTER THIS SHOW
8:10
AND BARACK OBAMA WAS STEALING YOUR CAR,
8:13
YOU WOULDN'T YELL, "HEY! SOMEONE STOP THAT MIXED GUY!"
8:18
[ LAUGHTER ]
8:20
YOU WOULDN'T.
8:22
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
8:24
YOU WOULDN'T SAY THAT.
8:27
OBAMA LOOKS BLACK, SO PEOPLE TREAT HIM BLACK.
8:30
IT'S LIKE, IT'S NEVER BEEN ABOUT WHO YOU ARE AS A PERSON,
8:33
'CAUSE THAT'S UP TO YOU.
8:34
YOU GOT TO CHOOSE THAT STUFF.
8:35
IT'S ABOUT HOW PEOPLE TREAT YOU. THAT'S WHAT RACE IS ABOUT.
8:38
LIKE, YOU KNOW, I GOT A LOT OF MIXED FRIENDS
8:40
WHO JUST DON'T KNOW HOW THEY FEEL ABOUT STUFF.
8:41
THEY'RE JUST LIKE, "I'M CULTURALLY CONFUSED."
8:43
AND I'M JUST LIKE, "MAN, NO, LISTEN.
8:45
IT'S ABOUT HOW PEOPLE TREAT YOU, OKAY?"
8:46
IF YOU'RE MIXED AND YOU'RE WALKING DOWN THE STREET
8:48
AND SOMEBODY ASKS YOU,
8:50
"HEY, WHAT DID YOU THINK OF THE MOVIE 'JULIE & JULIA'?"
8:52
YOU'RE WHITE.
8:54
[ LAUGHTER ]
8:55
NOBODY'S EVER COME UP TO ME AND ASKED ME ABOUT MY OPINIONS
8:58
ON "MAD MEN" AND "REVOLUTIONARY ROAD."
9:01
NO ONE, OKAY?
9:02
NOW, IF YOU'RE WALKING DOWN THE STREET AND YOU'RE MIXED
9:04
AND SOMEBODY'S LIKE, "HEY, WHAT DID YOU THINK
9:06
"OF LAST NIGHT'S EPISODE
9:07
OF 'THE REAL HOUSEWIVES OF ATLANTA'?"
9:08
YOU'RE BLACK.
9:10
OR GAY.
9:12
[ CHUCKLES ]
9:13
IT'S ONE OF THE TWO.
9:15
BUT THE BEST PART ABOUT OBAMA IS THAT HE'S A BLACK NERD.
9:20
I LOVE THAT JUNK.
9:21
'CAUSE I'M A BLACK NERD,
9:23
AND THAT [BLEEP] WAS ILLEGAL UNTIL LIKE 2003.
9:25
[ LAUGHTER, CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
9:28
IT'S AWESOME.
9:29
IT'S SO AWESOME.
9:31
IT'S JUST LIKE THERE'S BLACK NERDS EVERYWHERE.
9:33
YOU KNOW, IT'S AWESOME.
9:35
IT'S JUST LIKE THEY'RE EVERYWHERE NOW.
9:36
IT'S SO GREAT. AND I LOVE IT.
9:38
BUT IT WAS JUST HARD FOR US GROWING UP.
9:40
I REMEMBER I WAS LIKE THE ONLY BLACK KID
9:42
AT MY SCHOOL FOR A WHILE.
9:44
I REMEMBER I WENT TO A WHITE SCHOOL,
9:46
AND WHITE KIDS WERE EXCITED.
9:47
THEY WERE SUPER-EXCITED.
9:48
THEY WERE LIKE, "OH, WE GOT A BLACK KID!
9:50
THIS IS AWESOME! WE GOT A BLACK KID!"
9:51
THEY BE LIKE, "UH, HEY, DONALD,
9:53
"UH, WHAT KIND OF RAP MUSIC YOU INTO?
9:55
AND WHAT KIND OF SNEAKERS YOU LIKE?"
9:57
AND I WAS LIKE, "OH, I DON'T REALLY LIKE RAP MUSIC.
10:00
"I REALLY ENJOY THE SOULFUL STYLINGS OF THE CRANBERRIES.
10:02
"UM...
10:04
WE CAN TALK ABOUT THAT."
10:05
AND THEY WERE LIKE, "NO, MAN.
10:07
"YOU LIKE SNEAKERS, AND YOU LIKE RAP MUSIC,
10:09
AND YOU GONNA TELL US WHICH ONE YOU LIKE."
10:12
I WAS LIKE, "AAH, YOU'RE HURTING ME, STEVEN!"
10:13
YOU KNOW?
10:15
[ LAUGHTER ]
10:18
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
10:21
IT'S AWESOME. I LOVE IT.
10:24
BUT NOW I'M ALLOWED TO BE A BLACK NERD.
10:26
NOW I CAN DO THAT.
10:27
'CAUSE, LIKE, I'M ALLOWED TO BE A BLACK NERD.
10:29
AND A LOT OF PEOPLE BE LIKE,
10:30
"WELL, THERE WERE BLACK NERDS BEFORE.
10:31
THERE WERE BLACK NERDS BEFORE. WHAT ABOUT URKEL?"
10:33
[ LAUGHTER ]
10:35
URKEL WAS RETARDED. LET'S BE HONEST.
10:37
NO, HE WAS.
10:39
IF THERE WAS A KID NAMED STEVE URKEL
10:40
WHO WENT TO YOUR SCHOOL, DRESSED LIKE STEVE URKEL,
10:43
EATING CHEESE ALL THE TIME,
10:44
ALWAYS ASKING THIS GIRL NAMED LAURA TO MARRY HIM,
10:46
YOU'D BE LIKE, "OH, YEAH, STEVE?
10:48
"HIS BROTHER HIT HIM IN THE HEAD WITH A BRICK WHEN HE WAS 5.
10:50
VERY SAD SITUATION AT THE URKEL HOUSE."
10:53
THAT'S WHAT YOU SAY.
10:56
OKAY, HE'S NOT A NERD, OKAY? THAT'S NOT A NERD.
10:59
STRANGE, SPECIFIC STUFF -- THAT'S WHAT MAKES A NERD A NERD.
11:02
IF YOU LIKE STRANGE, SPECIFIC STUFF, THAT'S A NERD, OKAY?
11:05
KANYE WEST IS A BLACK NERD.
11:06
HE LIKES STRANGE, SPECIFIC STUFF.
11:09
IF YOU GO UP TO KANYE WEST AND SAY,
11:10
"HEY, WHAT ARE YOUR FAVORITE THINGS?"
11:12
HE'LL BE LIKE, "ROBOTS AND TEDDY BEARS."
11:14
THAT'S A NERD.
11:15
THAT'S A NERD.
11:20
RELATIONSHIPS ARE REALLY HARD.
11:22
LIKE, IT REALLY BROKE MY HEART.
11:23
LIKE, IT'S HARD, BUT, LIKE, YOU KNOW,
11:24
'CAUSE THERE'S SO MANY THINGS
11:25
THAT YOU LEARN IN A RELATIONSHIP,
11:27
ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU'RE REALLY IN LOVE AND STUFF LIKE THAT.
11:29
I REMEMBER -- GUYS, TELL ME IF THIS EVER HAPPENED TO YOU.

12:08
BUT BECAUSE SHE'S YOUR GIRL AND YOU LOVE HER, YOU BE LIKE,
12:11
"OH, WELL, YOU KNOW ME." [ CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY ]
12:14
THAT'S ALL YOU CAN SAY.
12:17
AND NO DUDE IN THE WORLD CAN GET AWAY WITH THAT JUNK.
12:19
DUDES, IF YOUR FRIEND CAME UP TO YOU,
12:21
YOU'D LOOK AT HIM LIKE HE WAS CRAZY.
12:23
BOOM -- "HEY, MAN, I HAD A DREAM WHERE YOU WERE MEAN TO ME!"
12:27

ALSO, LIKE, WOMEN -- WHEN I STARTED LISTENING TO THEM,

WE HAD A TEACHER NAMED MR. BROWN,
16:23
AND HE WAS WRITING SOMETHING ON THE BOARD ONCE.
16:25
HE WAS WRITING SOMETHING ON THE BOARD,
16:27
AND HE FARTED.
16:29
[ LAUGHTER ]
16:30
AND YOU WOULD HAVE THOUGHT KIDS HAD SEEN THE FACE OF GOD.
16:34
[ LAUGHTER ]
16:35
KIDS WEREN'T EVEN LAUGHING.
16:38
THEY WERE JUST SITTING THERE. THEY'RE LIKE...
16:39
[ SCREAMING ]
16:41
THEY'RE JUST, LIKE, SCREAMING, JUST SCREAMING.
16:45
KIDS HAD TO GET CARTED OUT.
16:49
KIDS WERE SCREAMING AND CRYING.
16:50
LIKE, KIDS HAD TO GET CARTED OUT,
16:52
AND THEY WERE GOING TO, LIKE, THE NURSE'S OFFICE.
16:54
KIDS WERE CRYING IN THE HALLWAY.
16:56
IT WAS JUST LIKE, "OH, THIS IS OUR 9/11!"
16:58
AND IT WAS!
17:01
IT WAS THEIR 9/11,
17:03
'CAUSE THEY NEVER THOUGHT ANYTHING LIKE THAT
17:05
COULD EVER HAPPEN.
17:07
KIDS WERE OUT IN THE HALLWAYS GIVING INTERVIEWS.
17:09
THEY WERE LIKE, "OH, MY GOD, I REMEMBER,
17:11
"BECAUSE I WAS TALKING TO BERTRAM HARRIS,
17:13
"AND HE SAID IF MY HAND WAS BIGGER THAN MY FACE,
17:14
"THEN I HAD AIDS.
17:15
"SO I PUT MY HAND IN FRONT OF MY FACE.
17:17
"AND THEN HE SLAMMED IT.
17:18
"IT WAS A VERY FUNNY JOKE.
17:20
"BUT THEN, ALL OF A SUDDEN,
17:21
"WE HEARD THIS SOUND FROM THE FRONT OF THE ROOM.
17:24
"AND IT WAS MR. BROWN.
17:26
"AND THEN JOHNNY SEAWRIGHT STOOD UP AND SAID,
17:28
'MR. BROWN BROWNED HIS PANTS!'"
17:31
[ LAUGHTER, CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
17:35
"AND THAT WAS EVEN FUNNIER!
17:38
"MY HEART GOES OUT TO THE PARENTS OF THE CHILDREN
17:41
"WHO SMELLED THE FART.
17:43
"BECAUSE THAT'S EVEN FUNNIER THAN HEARING IT.
17:46
IS THERE A GOD?"
17:47
YOU KNOW?
17:50
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
17:55
LIKE I SAID, I WAS, LIKE, GROWING UP IN A FOSTER HOME.
17:57
IT WAS CRAZY, MAN.
17:58
I REMEMBER THIS ONE TIME,
18:00
LIKE, MY MOM BROUGHT HOME THIS KID,
18:02
AND SHE WAS LIKE, "NOW, BE VERY CAREFUL WITH HIM.
18:05
HE WAS MOLESTED."
18:06
AND I HAD NEVER HEARD THAT WORD BEFORE.
18:07
I WAS LIKE 8 YEARS OLD.
18:08
I WAS LIKE, "OH, MY GOD. WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?"
18:10
AND SHE WAS LIKE, "OH, GOD.
18:12
"UM...THAT MEANS A GROWN-UP MAN...
18:16
TOUCHED HIS [BLEEP] OR HIS BUTT, AND HE DIDN'T WANT IT."
18:19
[ LAUGHTER ]
18:22
AND I MISHEARD HER.
18:24
I THOUGHT SHE SAID A GROWN-UP MAN
18:26
MADE HIM STICK HIS OWN [BLEEP] IN HIS OWN BUTT.
18:38
SO NOW I'M TERRIFIED TO USE THE BATHROOM
18:43
IN ANY PUBLIC PLACE,
18:44
'CAUSE I THINK A DUDE WITH A GUN
18:46
IS GONNA COME AT ME LIKE -- BOOM --
18:47
"STICK YOUR OWN [BLEEP] IN YOUR OWN BUTT!"
18:49
I BE LIKE, "I CAN'T! IT'S NOT LONG ENOUGH!
18:52
I'M JUST A LITTLE BOY!"
18:53
"SHUT UP!"
18:55
[ IMITATES GUNSHOT ] "AAH!"
18:56
AND I'D DIE, RIGHT?
18:58
I'D DIE.
19:00
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
19:03
I THOUGHT [LAUGHS]
19:05
I THOUGHT THAT WAS GONNA HAPPEN. I WAS REALLY SCARED.
19:08
AND NOW I'M OBSESSED WITH THIS KID'S [BLEEP]
19:10
LIKE, I'M OBSESSED.
19:12
EVERY TIME WE USE THE BATHROOM, I'M LOOKING AT HIM LIKE,
19:13
"IT DOESN'T LOOK LONG ENOUGH TO GO IN HIS OWN BUTT.
19:16
"I'M SORRY. IT DOESN'T LOOK LONG ENOUGH.
19:17
HOW DID HE DO IT? OH, HE'S SUCH A SURVIVOR."
19:20
[ LAUGHTER ]
19:22
AND THEN HE WOULD, LIKE, LEAVE,
19:24
AND THEN I'D JUST, LIKE, TUG MY STUFF A LITTLE BIT.
19:27
I WOULD TUG IT SO IT WOULD BE LONG ENOUGH
19:28
TO GO IN MY OWN BUTT, IF IT EVER HAPPENED.
19:32
SO, LIKE, I WAS, LIKE, TERRIFIED,
19:34
AND THEN ONE DAY, I HAD AN EPIPHANY.
19:36
I'M LIKE, "I'M A GENIUS. I'M A FREAKING GENIUS.
19:38
"I DON'T HAVE TO GO THIS WAY. I CAN GO THIS WAY!
19:40
I'M A GENIUS! I'M A GENIUS!"
19:44
SO IF IT EVER HAPPENED, HE'D BE LIKE -- BOOM --
19:47
"STICK YOUR OWN [BLEEP] IN YOUR OWN BUTT!"
19:49
I'D BE LIKE -- POP --
19:51
[ LAUGHTER ]
19:53
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
20:11
"WHAT NOW, STRANGE MAN?
20:15
IT SEEMS THAT WE'RE AT AN IMPASSE."
20:17
[ LAUGHTER ]
20:18
YOU GUYS HAVE BEEN GREAT. THANK YOU SO MUCH.
20:20
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
