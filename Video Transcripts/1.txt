stationary you know and that you're so
5:10
vulnerable when you get when you're on
5:12
the expressway you're singing to
5:13
yourself you got your windows rolled up

rate per capita than Chicago does and I
5:35
said shoot I gladly take getting shot in
5:38
New Orleans any day of the week oh yeah
5:39
cause I mean think about it think about
5:41
it you first get shot somebody starts
5:42
playing the Jazz trombone just
5:44
celebrating your life
5:47
on your way down you smell fresh
5:48
Beignets being baked
5:51
