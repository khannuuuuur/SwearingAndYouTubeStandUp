THANK YOU.
0:27
HEY, WELCOME TO MY HALF-HOUR SPECIAL.
0:30
DOES ANYBODY KNOW WHO I AM ?
0:33
( man ) NO.
0:34
WHY DID A BUNCH OF PEOPLE WHO DON'T KNOW WHO I AM
0:36
SHOW AT MY SPECIAL ?
0:39
I USED TO LIVE HERE IN LOS ANGELES ON SIERRA BONITA
0:42
AND I HAD AN APARTMENT, AND I HAD A NEIGHBOR
0:44
AND WHENEVER HE WOULD KNOCK ON MY WALL
0:46
I KNEW HE WANTED ME TO TURN MY MUSIC DOWN,
0:48
AND THAT MADE ME ANGRY 'CAUSE I LIKE LOUD MUSIC,
0:50
SO WHEN HE KNOCKED ON THE WALL, I'D MESS WITH HIS HEAD.
0:53
I'D SAY, "GO AROUND !
0:58
"I CANNOT OPEN THE WALL.
1:04
"I DON'T KNOW IF YOU HAVE A DOORKNOB ON THE OTHER SIDE
1:07
"BUT OVER HERE THERE'S NOTHING.
1:11
IT'S JUST FLAT."
1:14
I LIKE AN ESCALATOR, MAN,
1:15
'CAUSE AN ESCALATOR CAN NEVER BREAK--
1:17
IT CAN ONLY BECOME STAIRS.
1:22
( scattered applause )
1:24
ALL RIGHT.
1:29
THERE WOULD NEVER BE
1:30
AN "ESCALATOR TEMPORARILY OUT OF ORDER" SIGN,
1:33
ONLY AN "ESCALATOR TEMPORARILY STAIRS.
1:37
SORRY FOR THE CONVENIENCE."
1:42
I RENT A LOT OF CARS, YOU KNOW, 'CAUSE I GO ON THE ROAD.
1:44
I RENT CARS, AND WHEN I DRIVE A RENTAL CAR
1:46
I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON WITH IT, RIGHT ?
1:48
SO A LOT OF TIMES I'LL DRIVE LIKE FOR TEN MILES
1:50
WITH THE EMERGENCY BRAKE ON.
1:53
THAT DOESN'T SAY A LOT FOR ME,
1:55
BUT IT REALLY DOESN'T SAY A LOT
1:56
FOR THE EMERGENCY BRAKE.
2:01
IT'S REALLY NOT AN EMERGENCY BRAKE.
2:02
IT'S AN EMERGENCY MAKE-THE-CAR-SMELL-FUNNY LEVER.
2:14
YOU KNOW, YOU CAN'T PLEASE ALL THE PEOPLE ALL THE TIME
2:17
AND LAST NIGHT, ALL THOSE PEOPLE WERE AT MY SHOW.
2:26
TO DO THIS SHOW I HAD TO LIKE TAKE A PHYSICAL.
2:28
THEY ASKED ME A BUNCH OF MEDICAL QUESTIONS...
2:32
AND THEY WERE LIKE "YES" AND "NO" QUESTIONS,
2:34
BUT THEY WERE VERY STRANGELY WORDED.
2:36
LIKE, "HAVE YOU EVER TRIED SUGAR...
2:39
OR P-C-P ?"
2:48
BUT I'M A STAND-UP COMEDIAN.
2:49
I GOT INTO COMEDY TO DO COMEDY, WHICH IS WEIRD, I KNOW.
2:53
BUT WHEN YOU'RE IN HOLLYWOOD AND YOU'RE A COMEDIAN
2:55
EVERYBODY WANTS YOU TO DO OTHER THINGS BESIDES COMEDY.
2:57
THEY SAY, "ALL RIGHT, YOU'RE A STAND-UP COMEDIAN.
2:59
"CAN YOU ACT ?
3:01
"CAN YOU WRITE ?
3:02
WRITE US A SCRIPT."
3:04
THEY WANT ME TO DO THINGS THAT'S RELATED TO COMEDY
3:05
BUT NOT COMEDY.
3:07
THAT'S NOT FAIR.
3:10
IT'S AS THOUGH IF I WAS A COOK
3:11
AND I WORKED MY ASS OFF TO BECOME A GOOD COOK
3:13
THEY SAID, "ALL RIGHT, YOU'RE A COOK...
3:15
CAN YOU FARM ?"
3:24
THIS SHOW'S GOING ALL RIGHT, I GUESS.
3:27
I'M TRYING TO FEEL IT OUT.
3:30
I WANTED TO BUY A CANDLEHOLDER, BUT THE STORE DIDN'T HAVE ONE,
3:32
SO I GOT A CAKE.
3:39
I WENT TO A CONCERT IN NEW YORK CITY WHERE I LIVE.
3:41
IT WAS A HEAVY METAL BAND CALLED "MONSTER MAGNET".
3:44
THEY WERE HEAVY, BOY.
3:46
THE SINGER HAD NO SHIRT ON AND LEATHER PANTS
3:49
AND HE WAS PLAYING LIKE A FLYING "V" GUITAR
3:52
AND HE STOOD ON THE MONITOR AND HE YELLS AT THE CROWD.
3:54
HE SAID, "HOW MANY OF YOU PEOPLE FEEL LIKE HUMAN BEINGS TONIGHT ?"
3:58
AND THEN HE SAID, "HOW MANY OF YOU PEOPLE FEEL LIKE ANIMALS ?"
4:02
AND THE THING IS
4:03
EVERYONE CHEERED AFTER THE ANIMALS PART
4:06
BUT I CHEERED AFTER THE HUMAN BEINGS PART
4:08
'CAUSE I DID NOT KNOW THERE WAS A SECOND PART TO THE QUESTION.
4:15
I SAID, "YES, I DO FEEL LIKE A HUMAN.
4:19
I DO NOT FEEL LIKE A TREE."
4:26
I DON'T HAVE A GIRLFRIEND.
4:28
I JUST KNOW A GIRL WHO WOULD GET REALLY MAD
4:30
IF SHE HEARD ME SAY THAT.
4:37
I GOT INTO AN ARGUMENT WITH A GIRLFRIEND INSIDE OF A TENT.
4:40
THAT'S A BAD PLACE FOR AN ARGUMENT,
4:42
'CAUSE THEN I TRIED TO WALK OUT AND SLAM THE FLAP.
4:47
HOW ARE YOU SUPPOSED TO EXPRESS YOUR ANGER
4:49
IN THIS SITUATION ?
4:51
ZIPPER IT UP REALLY QUICK ?
4:56
I LIKE TO DRINK BEFORE THE SHOW.
4:57
I HAVE A COUPLE DRINKS BEFORE I GO ON STAGE.
5:01
( applause )
5:05
EVERY TIME PEOPLE APPLAUD I'M ALWAYS GOING,
5:07
"NO, NO, NO, HOLD ON."
5:08
BUT ALCOHOLISM IS A DISEASE,
5:09
BUT IT'S LIKE THE ONLY DISEASE
5:11
THAT YOU CAN GET YELLED AT FOR HAVING.
5:13
( laughter )
5:19
( applause )
5:21
PROVOCATIVE...
5:24
"DAMN IT, OTTO, YOU'RE AN ALCOHOLIC."
5:27
"DAMN IT, OTTO, YOU HAVE LUPUS."
5:31
ONE OF THOSE TWO DOESN'T SOUND RIGHT.
5:38
I WANT TO BE A RACE CAR PASSENGER.
5:43
JUST THE GUY WHO BUGS THE DRIVER.
5:46
"SAY MAN, CAN I TURN ON THE RADIO ?
5:50
"YOU SHOULD SLOW DOWN.
5:52
"WHY DO WE GOT TO KEEP GOING IN CIRCLES ?
5:55
MAN, YOU REALLY LOOK TIRED."
6:07
I PLAY GOLF.
6:08
I'M NOT GOOD AT GOLF, I NEVER GOT A HOLE IN ONE.
6:11
BUT I DID HIT A GUY...
6:14
AND THAT'S WAY MORE SATISFYING.
6:19
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO YELL "FORE,"
6:20
BUT I WAS TOO BUSY MUMBLING,
6:22
"THERE AIN'T NO WAY THAT'S GONNA HIT HIM."
6:28
I BOUGHT A DOUGHNUT
6:29
AND THEY GAVE ME A RECEIPT FOR THE DOUGHNUT.
6:31
I DON'T NEED A RECEIPT FOR A DOUGHNUT.
6:32
I'LL JUST GIVE YOU THE MONEY,
6:33
YOU GIVE ME THE DOUGHNUT.
6:36
END OF TRANSACTION.
6:38
WE DON'T NEED TO BRING INK AND PAPER INTO THIS.
6:44
I... I JUST CANNOT IMAGINE THE SCENARIO
6:47
WHERE I'D HAVE TO PROVE THAT I BOUGHT A DOUGHNUT.
6:54
SOME SKEPTICAL FRIEND ?
6:56
DON'T EVEN ACT LIKE I DIDN'T GET THAT DOUGHNUT.
6:58
I GOT THE DOCUMENTATION RIGHT HERE.
7:07
OH WAIT, IT'S BACK HOME IN THE FILE...
7:10
UNDER "D", FOR DOUGHNUT.
7:14
I THINK WE ALL KNOW WHAT "D" IS.
7:17
I LIKE BAKED POTATOES.
7:17
I DON'T HAVE A MICROWAVE OVEN.
7:19
IT TAKES FOREVER TO COOK A BAKED POTATO IN A CONVENTIONAL OVEN.
7:22
SOMETIMES I'LL JUST THROW ONE IN THERE,
7:23
EVEN IF I DON'T WANT ONE.
7:26
BY THE TIME IT'S DONE, WHO KNOWS ?
7:32
I THROW A POTATO IN AND GO ON VACATION.
7:40
MY FRIEND DID THIS TO ME,
7:41
MY FRIEND CAME UP TO ME, AND HE SAID THIS--
7:42
HE SAID, "HEY, YOU KNOW WHAT I LIKE ?
7:44
MASHED POTATOES."
7:46
IT'S LIKE, DUDE, YOU GOT TO GIVE ME TIME TO GUESS.
7:53
( scattered applause )
7:56
IF YOU'RE GOING TO QUIZ ME, YOU MUST PUT A PAUSE IN THERE.
8:03
I HAD A BOX OF RITZ CRACKERS
8:05
AND ON THE BACK OF THE BOX OF RITZ CRACKERS
8:06
THEY HAD ALL THESE SUGGESTIONS
8:08
AS TO WHAT TO PUT ON TOP OF THE RITZ.
8:10
IT SAID, "TRY IT WITH TURKEY AND CHEESE.
8:13
TRY IT WITH PEANUT BUTTER."
8:15
OH COME ON, MAN, THEY'RE CRACKERS.
8:16
THAT'S WHY I GOT 'EM-- I LIKE CRACKERS.
8:20
NOW, THERE AIN'T NO SUGGESTION, "PUT A RITZ ON TOP OF A RITZ."
8:24
I DIDN'T BUY 'EM 'CAUSE THEY'RE LITTLE EDIBLE PLATES.
8:36
ONE TIME I GO TO LIKE A CRAFT FAIR,
8:38
I SEE A JAR OF JELLYBEANS.
8:40
IT SAID, "GUESS HOW MANY JELLYBEANS ARE IN THE JAR
8:42
AND YOU WIN A PRIZE."
8:45
"OH COME ON MAN, LET ME JUST HAVE SOME.
8:50
"I'LL TELL YOU WHAT-- YOU GUESS HOW MANY I WANT.
8:56
IF YOU SAID A HANDFUL, YOU ARE RIGHT."
9:02
I HAVE TWO SISTERS AND ONE OF THEM'S NAMED WENDY,
9:04
AND IF YOU ASKED WENDY IF I WAS WEIRD,
9:05
SHE'D PROBABLY SAY, "YEAH."
9:07
BUT THAT'S BACKWARDS 'CAUSE SHE'S WEIRD.
9:09
'CAUSE SHE HAS LIKE A HUSBAND AND TWO CHILDREN
9:13
AND THEY HAVE A FAMILY PHOTO ON TOP OF THEIR V-C-R
9:16
WHERE THEY'RE ALL LOOKING SLIGHTLY TO THE LEFT...
9:21
AS THOUGH SOMETHING IS GOING ON OVER THERE.
9:25
THE CAMERA IS RIGHT IN FRONT OF YOU,
9:29
BUT I GUESS SOMETHING HAPPENED TO THE LEFT...
9:32
THAT MADE EVERYBODY HAPPY.
9:38
EXCEPT MY SISTER IS CROSS-EYED,
9:41
SO SHE CAN'T QUITE PULL IT OFF.
9:44
ONE EYE IS RIGHT ON.
9:56
I WAS AT A CASINO, I WAS STANDING BY THE DOOR...
9:59
( laughs )
10:01
AND A SECURITY GUARD CAME OVER.
10:02
HE SAID, "YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO MOVE.
10:03
YOU'RE BLOCKING THE FIRE EXIT."
10:05
AS THOUGH IF THERE WAS A FIRE, I WASN'T GONNA RUN.
10:12
IF YOU'RE FLAMMABLE AND HAVE LEGS
10:14
YOU ARE NEVER BLOCKING A FIRE EXIT.
10:21
I HATE TURKEYS.
10:26
IF YOU GO TO THE GROCERY STORE
10:27
AND YOU STAND IN FRONT OF THE LUNCH MEAT SECTION FOR TOO LONG
10:29
YOU START TO GET PISSED OFF AT TURKEYS.
10:32
YOU SEE LIKE TURKEY HAM, TURKEY PASTRAMI, TURKEY BOLOGNA.
10:35
SOMEBODY NEEDS TO TELL THE TURKEYS,
10:37
"MAN, JUST BE YOURSELF.
10:44
"I ALREADY LIKE YOU, LITTLE BROTHER.
10:47
"YOU DO NOT NEED TO EMULATE THE OTHER ANIMALS.
10:50
"YOU GOT YOUR OWN THING GOING.
10:53
I USED TO DRAW YOU."
11:03
YOU KNOW, IF YOU HAD A COUPLE FINGERS MISSING
11:04
YOU WOULD DRAW A SCREWED-UP TURKEY.
11:06
THAT TURKEY WAS IN AN ACCIDENT.
11:09
I GO TO A LOT OF BARS WHEN I'M ON THE ROAD.
11:11
A LOT OF BARS HAVE BLACK LIGHTS, AND WHEN A BAR HAS BLACK LIGHTS,
11:14
EVERYBODY LOOKS VERY COOL, EXCEPT FOR ME.
11:16
'CAUSE I WAS UNDER THE IMPRESSION
11:18
THAT THE MUSTARD STAIN CAME OUT.
11:25
I THINK PIZZA HUT
11:26
IS THE COCKIEST PIZZA CHAIN ON THE PLANET,
11:28
BECAUSE PIZZA HUT WILL ACCEPT ALL COMPETITORS' COUPONS.
11:31
THAT MAKES ME WISH I HAD MY OWN PIZZA PLACE...
11:34
MITCH'S PIZZERIA.
11:36
THIS WEEK'S COUPON, "UNLIMITED FREE PIZZA".
11:45
SPECIAL NOTE, "COUPON NOT GOOD
11:46
"AT ANY OF THE MITCH'S PIZZA LOCATIONS.
11:51
"FREE PIZZA OVEN WITH PURCHASE...
11:55
OF A SMALL COKE."
11:59
( laughs )
12:00
"TWO FOR TUESDAY--
12:01
BUY ONE PIZZA, GET ONE FRANCHISE FREE."
12:06
WHENEVER I WALK, PEOPLE TRY TO HAND ME OUT FLIERS
12:08
AND WHEN SOMEONE TRIES TO HAND ME OUT A FLIER
12:09
IT'S KIND OF LIKE THEY'RE SAYING, "HERE.
12:11
YOU THROW THIS AWAY."
12:21
I CAN'T FLOSS MY TEETH, MAN.
12:24
I CAN'T GET INTO THE FLOSSING THING.
12:26
PEOPLE WHO SMOKE CIGARETTES, THEY SAY,
12:27
"MAN, YOU DON'T KNOW HOW HARD IT IS TO QUIT SMOKING."
12:30
YES, I DO.
12:31
IT'S AS HARD AS IT IS TO START FLOSSING.
12:36
"YOU SEEM JITTERY."
12:38
"YEAH. I'M ABOUT TO FLOSS."
12:43
I LIKE CINNAMON ROLLS, THAT'S WHY I WISH
12:45
THEY MADE LIKE A CINNAMON ROLL INCENSE,
12:47
'CAUSE I DON'T ALWAYS HAVE TIME TO MAKE A PAN.
12:50
PERHAPS I'D RATHER LIGHT A STICK
12:53
AND THEN HAVE MY ROOMMATES WAKE UP WITH FALSE HOPES.
13:03
I PLAYED IN A DEATH METAL BAND.
13:05
PEOPLE EITHER LOVED US OR THEY HATED US
13:07
OR THEY THOUGHT WE WERE OKAY.
13:13
A LOT OF DEATH METAL BANDS HAVE INTENSE NAMES
13:15
LIKE "RIGOR MORTIS",
13:16
OR "MORTUARY",
13:18
OR "OBITUARY."
13:19
WE WEREN'T THAT INTENSE--
13:20
WE JUST WENT WITH "INJURED".
13:24
LATER ON, WE CHANGED IT TO "A CAPPELLA"
13:27
AS WE WERE WALKING OUT OF THE PAWN SHOP.
13:37
I SMOKE CIGARS OCCASIONALLY.
13:38
I DON'T KNOW A LOT ABOUT CIGARS.
13:39
AT THE CIGAR STORE, THE MAN BEHIND THE COUNTER SAID,
13:41
"WHAT KIND OF CIGARS DO YOU LIKE ?"
13:43
"AH... IT'S A BOYs."
13:54
I WAS AT A BAR, I WAS MINDING MY OWN BUSINESS.
13:56
NO ONE WAS TALKING TO ME 'CAUSE I JUST DID A SHOW.
14:05
THIS GUY BUMPED INTO ME, WHICH IS COOL
14:06
BUT HE DIDN'T APOLOGIZE.
14:07
HE SAID, "MOVE."
14:09
AND I THOUGHT THAT WAS RUDE, SO I SAID, "GO TO HELL."
14:11
THEN I STARTED TO RUN.
14:14
HE CAUGHT UP WITH ME.
14:16
HE HAD A MUSTACHE, A GOATEE
14:18
A PAIR OF EARRINGS, A PAIR OF SUNGLASSES,
14:19
HIS HAIR WAS IN A PONYTAIL AND HE WAS WEARING A HAT.
14:22
HE SAID, "HEY, YOU GOT A LOT OF NERVE."
14:24
I SAID, "HEY, YOU GOT A LOT OF...
14:26
CRANIUM ACCESSORIES."
14:34
THIS IS A SMART CROWD.
14:35
WHEN I PLAY THE DUMB CROWDS
14:37
I HAVE TO SAY, "YOU GOT A LOT OF ( bleep ) ON YOUR HEAD."
14:42
ACID WAS MY FAVORITE DRUG.
14:43
ACID OPENED UP MY MIND.
14:44
IT EXPANDED MY MIND.
14:46
( cheering )
14:49
BECAUSE OF ACID
14:50
I NOW KNOW THAT BUTTER IS WAY BETTER THAN MARGARINE.
14:54
I SAW THROUGH THE BULL ( bleep ).
15:01
WHEN I WAS ON ACID, I WOULD SEE THINGS LIKE BEAMS OF LIGHT
15:05
AND I WOULD HEAR SOUNDS THAT SOUNDED
15:06
AN AWFUL LOT LIKE CAR HORNS.
15:18
( laughs )
15:20
WHEN WE WERE ON ACID, WE WOULD GO INTO THE WOODS,
15:21
'CAUSE WHEN YOU'RE IN THE WOODS TRIPPING
15:22
THERE'S LESS LIKELY A CHANCE YOU'D RUN INTO AN AUTHORITY FIGURE,
15:26
BUT WE RAN INTO A BEAR.
15:29
THAT WAS EVEN MORE OF A BUZZ-KILL.
15:32
MY FRIEND DWAYNE WAS STANDING THERE
15:33
RAISING HIS RIGHT HAND,
15:35
SWEARING TO HELP PREVENT FOREST FIRES.
15:43
WE GOT HIM AWAY FROM THE BEAR,
15:44
HE PUT HIS ARM AROUND MY SHOULDER.
15:46
HE SAID, "MITCHELL, SMOKEY IS WAY MORE INTENSE IN PERSON."
15:54
I WENT TO ENGLAND TO TELL JOKES
15:56
AND I WANTED TO DO MY "SMOKEY THE BEAR" JOKE IN ENGLAND,
15:58
SO I HAD TO ASK THE ENGLISH PEOPLE
15:59
IF THEY KNOW WHO SMOKEY THE BEAR WAS, BUT THEY DON'T
16:03
BECAUSE IN ENGLAND SMOKEY THE BEAR
16:05
IS NOT THE FOREST FIRE PREVENTION REPRESENTATIVE.
16:12
THEY HAVE "SMACKY THE FROG".
16:16
IT'S A LOT LIKE A BEAR, BUT IT'S A FROG
16:19
AND I THINK THAT'S A BETTER SYSTEM.
16:20
I THINK WE SHOULD ADOPT IT,
16:22
BECAUSE BEARS CAN BE MEAN...
16:25
BUT FROGS ARE ALWAYS COOL.
16:28
NEVER HAS THERE BEEN A FROG HOPPING TOWARD ME
16:31
AND I THOUGHT, "MAN, I'D BETTER PLAY DEAD.
16:36
HERE COMES THAT FROG."
16:39
I'VE NEVER SAID, "HERE COMES THAT FROG"
16:41
IN A HORRIFYING MANNER.
16:43
IT'S ALWAYS LIKE OPTIMISTIC.
16:45
LIKE, "HEY, HERE COMES THAT FROG.
16:48
"ALL RIGHT.
16:50
"MAYBE HE WILL SETTLE NEAR ME...
16:53
"AND I CAN PET HIM...
16:56
"AND PUT HIM IN A MAYONNAISE JAR
17:00
"WITH A STICK AND A LEAF...
17:03
TO RECREATE WHAT HE'S USED TO."
17:17
I WEAR V-NECK SHIRTS.
17:18
THIS IS A V-NECK I GOT ON.
17:21
MY NECK IS SO FRAGILE, MAN.
17:22
I CAN'T WEAR A REGULAR-NECK SHIRT, IT HURTS.
17:26
AND I ESPECIALLY HATE TURTLENECKS.
17:28
LIKE WEARING A TURTLENECK IS LIKE BEING STRANGLED
17:30
BY A REALLY WEAK GUY...
17:36
ALL DAY.
17:39
LIKE IF YOU WEAR A TURTLENECK AND A BACKPACK
17:41
IT'S LIKE A WEAK MIDGET TRYING TO BRING YOU DOWN.
17:53
YOU KNOW WHEN YOU GO IN A RESTAURANT ON THE WEEKENDS
17:54
IT GETS BUSY, SO THEY START A WAITING LIST.
17:56
THEY START CALLING OUT NAMES.
17:57
THEY SAY LIKE, "DUFRAINE, PARTY OF TWO.
18:00
TABLE READY FOR DUFRAINE, PARTY OF TWO."
18:02
AND IF NO ONE ANSWERS, THEY'LL SAY THE NAME AGAIN.
18:04
"DUFRAINE, PARTY OF TWO,"
18:07
BUT THEN IF NO ONE ANSWERS
18:08
THEY'LL JUST GO RIGHT ON TO THE NEXT NAME.
18:10
"BUSH, PARTY OF THREE."
18:12
YEAH, BUT WHAT HAPPENED TO THE DUFRAINES ?
18:15
NO ONE SEEMS TO CARE.
18:20
WHO CAN EAT AT A TIME LIKE THIS ?
18:23
PEOPLE ARE MISSING.
18:28
YOU PEOPLE ARE SELFISH.
18:31
THE DUFRAINES ARE IN SOMEONE'S TRUNK RIGHT NOW...
18:35
WITH DUCT TAPE OVER THEIR MOUTHS
18:39
AND THEY'RE HUNGRY.
18:42
THAT'S A DOUBLE WHAMMY.
18:44
WE NEED HELP.
18:46
"BUSH, SEARCH PARTY OF THREE.
18:50
YOU CAN EAT ONCE YOU FIND THE DUFRAINES."
19:02
I THINK PRINGLES' INITIAL INTENTION
19:04
WAS TO MAKE TENNIS BALLS.
19:11
BUT ON THE DAY THAT THE RUBBER WAS SUPPOSED TO SHOW UP
19:13
A BIG TRUCKLOAD OF POTATOES ARRIVED.
19:17
AND PRINGLES IS A LAID-BACK COMPANY,
19:19
THEY SAID, "( bleep ) IT, CUT 'EM UP."
19:27
I WROTE A SCRIPT AND I GAVE IT TO A GUY WHO READS SCRIPTS
19:29
AND HE READ IT, AND HE SAID HE REALLY LIKES IT
19:31
BUT HE THINKS I NEED TO REWRITE IT.
19:33
I SAID, "( bleep ) THAT.
19:34
I'LL JUST MAKE A COPY."
19:48
I LOVE YOU GUYS.
19:51
THANKS FOR COMING TO MY SPECIAL.
