This is "Comedy Central Stand-Up Presents."
0:12
Ladies and gentlemen, Langston Kerman.
0:17
( cheers, applause )
0:19
Hi! Hey!
0:23
Hey! What's up, New Orleans? Hi!
0:27
Oh, this is tight! What up?
0:30
I'm so excited to be-- I love New Orleans, man.
0:32
- I really do. - ( cheers, applause )
0:36
I just been drinking Hand Grenades
0:37
and shitting neon. It's tight.
0:41
My shit coming out spooky! I love this place!
0:45
This is great, man. Thank you for being here.
0:47
I've been traveling a lot.
0:48
I've been, like, on the road quite a bit.
0:50
I spent a month this year in Canada.
0:53
I was, like, living in Canada.
0:55
Yeah, it's just better.
0:58
It's better than America, y'all.
1:00
Like, you don't have to be here. It's better.
1:03
I like Canada. They're doing some progressive shit in Canada.
1:06
I saw a white woman washing windows.
1:08
You know what I mean?
1:10
Do you understand how exciting that was for me?
1:13
Just walking past, like, "Oh, shit, y'all do that?
1:16
I didn't know you had those muscles."
1:20
It blew my-- a part of me wanted to run up to her
1:22
and be like, "Psst! Hey, white girl.
1:24
Youse can be free.
1:28
You can be free, white girl.
1:29
You ain't got to live like this no more.
1:32
In America, there are vintage furniture stores
1:34
as far as the eye can see.
1:36
You can bring your dog inside of restaurants.
1:40
Just ruin people's meal with pet dander and privilege."
1:45
( applause )
1:46
"Listen, white girl. Listen to me. Listen to me!
1:49
Free yourself. Free yourself!
1:51
Find the North Star, and then walk backwards.
1:57
To freedom!
1:59
Get on that above-ground railroad!
2:02
It's just a regular train.
2:05
It's a reasonably-priced train."
2:09
I just want a white slave so bad.
2:13
I do. I just want one of y'all singing slave hymnals,
2:16
you know what I mean?
2:17
Just like, ♪ Wade in da water ♪
2:21
♪ Wade in da water ♪
2:24
Karen! ♪ Wade ♪
2:27
♪ In da water ♪
2:29
♪ Karen gon' send back the water ♪
2:33
♪ This isn't Pellegrino water ♪
2:36
♪ She specifically asked for Pellegrino water ♪
2:43
This is what my comedy's like.
2:47
I don't know. This is tight, man.
2:48
I used to live with a white woman.
2:50
That was pretty cool.
2:52
I did. I lived with a white woman
2:54
for like a year, and it was beautiful.
2:56
We, like, really, like, learned so much about each other
2:58
and shared this really beautiful bond.
3:00
I should be clear. We weren't having sex. I know the law.
3:03
But, like...
3:06
...we were roommates.
3:11
It was tight, man. I really learned--
3:13
My white woman, she believed in ghosts.
3:16
I call her "my white woman" because I own her, right?
3:19
Y'all don't want her back.
3:22
I was playing too much DMX in the house. She's ruined.
3:26
It's not good.
3:28
My white woman believed in ghosts.
3:31
Any of y'all do that? Any of you nice white ladies believe in ghosts?
3:34
Yeah? Some of you? You do?
3:36
Okay, cool. Why?
3:40
Why do you do that? Have you ever seen a ghost?
3:43
No. Never once in your life?
3:45
So, you just want to be scared when you're shitting and stuff?
3:50
You just want to be a little nervous
3:52
when you're cooking dinner and all that.
3:54
My-- she was like you. She actively believed that ghosts exist.
3:58
One time she woke me up, middle of the night.
3:59
She came to my room to tell me she thinks our apartment is haunted,
4:03
because she could hear sounds in the walls.
4:06
We lived in Brooklyn, New York.
4:10
You under-- She came up, "Oh, my God, Langston,
4:12
I think we have ghosts. I can hear them in the walls."
4:14
To which I replied, "Hush.
4:18
Hush. Hey, what do you need?
4:20
What do you need? Almond butter duvet covers?
4:22
Hush. We don't have ghosts.
4:24
Look at our neighbor-- look where we live.
4:26
There's no ghosts. We're just poor."
4:30
That's the sweet sound of poverty, baby girl.
4:34
That's not a ghost rattling his chains.
4:36
That's a crackhead having sex with a shopping cart.
4:41
That's how they procreate.
4:43
That's why every crackhead has a shopping cart.
4:45
They're life partners."
4:47
Right? "With this ringworm, I be wed."
4:55
I do think that's the best part about being a white woman.
4:58
I'll say that. I do.
5:00
I think that's-- you guys get to believe in ghosts,
5:02
and that's really nice.
5:04
I don't get to believe-- you know how silly I'd be
5:06
to be like, "Yo, ( bleep ), there's ghosts in here."
5:11
I have a hard enough time convincing my black friends
5:13
we can shop at The Gap.
5:16
"At The Gap? Mother-- I can't shop at The Gap!
5:19
( bleep ) I look like, Ross from 'Friends'?
5:23
Oh, you just want me to dance in a goddamn--
5:25
Let me tell you something.
5:26
They gave my brother 10 years for dancing in a fountain.
5:30
Said he ruined all those wishes."
5:33
Contaminated the water.
5:39
Black people don't get to believe in shit.
5:41
We don't get to be whimsical like y'all.
5:43
We don't get to use our imaginations or nothing.
5:45
This is how (bleep ) up America is.
5:47
Black people don't even get to believe in police brutality.
5:51
I knew this wasn't gonna be fun no more.
5:53
( laughter, applause )
5:56
We don't! All these years we've been screaming,
5:58
"The police, they're killing us.
5:59
They're murdering-- they're doing unfair--
6:01
we just want it to be fair."
6:03
And white people are like, "No!
6:05
No, hey, stop it! Shut up!
6:07
The police are our friends.
6:10
Sh-- yeah-- shut-- hey, sure he shot you,
6:12
but you wiggled. You shouldn't have wiggled.
6:15
You're a wiggler!
6:17
You're a dirty, rotten wiggler.
6:19
A no-good, welfare wiggler."
6:23
And then one white lady's like,
6:25
"I think I have a ghost in my apartment.
6:29
I haven't seen it, but my salad bowl was over here,
6:31
and now it's over here."
6:35
And all of white America's like, "We believe you."
6:38
We believe every word.
6:39
The world is filled with possibility."
6:44
It's a tough time in America right now, man.
6:46
Everybody's, you know, very tense,
6:49
and I don't have any, like, crazy insights or anything.
6:51
I'll say this, if we learned anything from the past election,
6:54
I think it's that white people sure know how to keep a secret.
6:59
Do you know what I mean?
7:01
No? You guys did a number on us.
7:04
And I don't know if y'all had a group chat, or like...
7:09
...if that's what y'all talk about at West Elm,
7:11
but my goodness.
7:13
My God, was this the first year
7:15
where we kinda thought we were on the same page.
7:18
Like, as a-- we were like, "Well, we not--
7:20
we not gonna make him the president, right?
7:22
He not gonna be in charge of everything, right?
7:25
He's not gonna be the president of the United States."
7:27
And then, as soon as that voter booth went up,
7:30
as soon as that divider went into place,
7:32
y'all were like, "Mm mm mm.
7:35
I like his hair. Ha ha ha!
7:37
I've liked his hair this whole time.
7:41
I know I said I didn't like it,
7:42
but I like it... Jamal.
7:45
Dumb-ass Jamal."
7:50
Find things that make you happy, man.
7:52
I think that's the key.
7:53
I'm in-- I'm in love.
7:55
- I got a girlfriend, she's tight. - ( cheers, applause )
7:58
Yeah. It's great, man.
7:59
We just moved to Los Angeles together.
8:01
We were living long-distance before this, which is tough.
8:04
Anybody doing long-distance relationships?
8:06
- Anybody doing? Yeah? - ( scattered cheers )
8:07
It's hard, right?
8:09
She was in Baltimore, I was in New York.
8:11
So it was, like, three hours, and it's tough, man.
8:13
It's hard to make someone feel sexy from a distance.
8:16
Because sex is present, it's now,
8:17
it's right in front of you.
8:19
There's nothing you can do to replicate--
8:20
I can't, like, be on the phone, like, "Ha ha, yeah, girl.
8:23
I'ma tear that ass up...
8:26
in two to three weeks time.
8:28
Whoo! I hope you getting wet, girl!
8:31
And then I hope you store that wet.
8:34
Maybe put it in some Tupperware or on ice.
8:37
I'll get to it.
8:39
Ooh, what am I gonna do to you, girl?
8:41
What am I gonna do to you? Well, first of all,
8:44
I'm gonna take a Chinatown bus.
8:48
That's right, the illegal one.
8:50
I'ma ride that for about six to eight hours,
8:53
even though it should only take three.
8:56
Ooh, and the whole time I'm on that bus, girl?
8:58
I said, the whole time I'm on that bus?
9:01
I'ma be sitting next to an old Asian man
9:04
holding a live rooster.
9:08
Why is that bird on that bus? It's hard to say, girl.
9:11
Tell you this, that rooster is not happy about it.
9:14
And baby, baby, baby, sweetheart, lil' mama,
9:16
when I finally make it to Baltimore,
9:17
I said, when I finally make it to where you live-- ha ha!
9:21
I'm probably gonna be too tired to have sex with you.
9:25
It has been a long day.
9:28
Would you like to fall asleep watching prison shows?"
9:34
It was just hard.
9:35
My girlfriend's mom is single.
9:37
She's dating, at 60, and that's hard, right?
9:40
And that's not, like, funny.
9:41
You laughed 'cause you're an asshole, but like--
9:45
You're not a good dude. I can see that now.
9:49
I liked you at first, but now you're just a monster.
9:54
She is, she's dating,
9:55
and so we care, we love her, right?
9:57
So to help her, we made her an OKCupid account.
10:01
Right. It didn't help at all.
10:03
But I'll say this, it has been the thrill of my life.
10:07
I got her passwords. I read every note...
10:10
- ( audience groans ) - ...that she writes,
10:12
and every one that comes back.
10:13
I love how older people talk to each other, man.
10:15
I do. Like, online? It's so charming
10:17
because they're so raw and honest
10:20
in a way that we as young people don't know how to be,
10:22
because we're presenting. They don't give a ( bleep ), right?
10:25
So the websites will say, like, "Hey,
10:27
list ten fun facts about yourself,
10:29
and we'll help you find that sp--"
10:31
and they just list the first ten facts
10:34
that pop into their head.
10:36
So it will be like, "Construction worker!
10:38
Lonely! Hemorrhoids!" Like, that's it.
10:42
"Love me!"
10:45
Every older person's profile reads
10:47
like this unwavering stream of consciousness,
10:50
do you know what I mean?
10:51
Just like an old man yelling into the wind, like,
10:53
"Hello!
10:55
Hello!
10:57
I am FedoraDaddy1978!
11:02
I'm a divorced father of three!
11:03
But don't worry, my kids don't call me anymore.
11:08
I was recently fired from my job
11:10
for only knowing how to type with one finger!
11:13
I'll let you guess which finger!
11:17
I'm looking for that special someone who can love me
11:20
and help me figure out if my milk is expired.
11:24
How can you tell? I tried sniffing it,
11:26
but that's how they get you.
11:29
Call me on my email.
11:33
I'll be here any time, day or night.
11:35
I don't sleep much, as I'm very worried
11:37
my son might be a homosexual.
11:41
How can you tell? I tried sniffing the boy,
11:43
but that's how they get you.
11:46
PS-- No fatties."
11:54
This is a fun job we get to do, man.
11:56
It really is. I used to be--
11:58
I used to be a high school teacher.
12:00
( cheers, applause )
12:01
Yeah. Don't clap.
12:03
I quit in the middle of the year.
12:04
I didn't give a shit about those kids.
12:08
I quit on a Wednesday. I didn't give a ( bleep ).
12:12
I quit at fourth period. I was done.
12:15
Kids were like, "Mr. Karman, what's our homework for tomorrow?"
12:18
I was like, "I don't know, man.
12:19
That sounds like a Tomorrow Lady question.
12:23
I ain't gonna be here. I'm not invested."
12:27
Teaching's tough, man. Are there teachers here?
12:30
Some of y'all work in education?
12:31
- ( cheers, applause ) - It's beautiful.
12:33
It's just a hard job.
12:34
I've never been called "Mister" and "bitch" more in my life.
12:38
It's like, "Mister, why you a bitch?
12:41
No, I'm saying, like, why is that your personality?
12:44
You got some bitch-ass handwriting, Mister.
12:46
You must write with a feather.
12:49
You write with a quill, Mister?"
12:54
One time I had a kid call me "Mr. Bitch."
12:59
And that hurt more, somehow.
13:01
Here's why "Mr. Bitch" hurts more,
13:02
and I thought a lot-- I think about it almost every day.
13:06
"Mr. Bitch" hurts more because "Mr. Bitch"
13:09
makes it seem like I earned the title.
13:13
You know what I mean? Like I worked my way up.
13:15
Like while the rest of you were lollygagging
13:17
and playing around, I was focused
13:20
on being the best bitch I could be.
13:24
It's just a hard job, man.
13:26
I had to pretend like drugs aren't cool.
13:30
Just talking like, "Kids, don't do drugs!
13:32
Why would you do drugs?
13:34
Nothing good-- listen.
13:35
You'll just end up having sex
13:36
with the prettiest girl in school.
13:40
What, do you want to get your ( bleep ) sucked at Prom?
13:42
Disgusting!
13:44
Hey, you know what's better than ( bleep ) sucking?
13:46
You know what's better than that?
13:47
Subject-verb agreement.
13:50
Huh? Grammar rules!
13:51
You gotta finger-bang your brain.
13:55
Let's get wet up here where it counts."
14:01
Drugs are dope, man.
14:04
I think we can all agree with that.
14:06
Drugs are tight, right?
14:07
( cheers, applause )
14:09
Some of the coolest things that have ever happened in the world
14:11
happened because of drugs,
14:13
because someone was high on drugs.
14:15
And I say all that, and I don't even do drugs.
14:18
I don't do any, I swear. I don't smoke weed.
14:21
Heroin gives me tummyaches. I don't do anything.
14:25
I have a very sensitive stomach to heroin.
14:27
I got the allergy you always read about.
14:29
I'm always at restaurants like,
14:30
"Hey, I hate to be that guy,
14:33
but is there any heroin in the Caesar salad?
14:35
I can't-- I can't take it.
14:37
I'll get the shakes. I'll steal my mom's TV.
14:39
I can't do it again."
14:44
Never did drugs, even as a kid.
14:45
I was, like, a square kid.
14:48
Sometimes I feel like the only kid who fell for the DARE campaign.
14:53
Y'all remember, they had the kids on TV.
14:55
Like, "Ew, gross, marijuana?
14:59
That stuff's illegal."
15:03
And then we were supposed to believe
15:04
that kid had sex ever again, you know what I mean?
15:07
Women don't have sex with snitches.
15:10
They don't. I'm not an expert on girls,
15:12
and I don't pretend to be, but I've never heard a girl
15:14
say this out loud, like, "Hey.
15:16
You know what turns me on?
15:18
A guy who calls the police for noise violations.
15:22
Mm, tuck in that t-shirt, daddy.
15:26
Play that clarinet.
15:31
Those DARE commercials used to be wild, right?
15:33
I remember one, this was the worst.
15:36
They had one with a talking dog.
15:38
Y'all remember that one?
15:39
The girl-- if you don't remember, this girl,
15:41
she gets super high on marijuana,
15:43
and her dog starts talking to her, right?
15:45
And her dog starts saying some pretty real shit.
15:49
Like her dog basically says,
15:50
"Look, ever since you started doing drugs,
15:53
our relationship has changed.
15:55
You're not the same person you used to be.
15:57
I just wish we could go back to what we had."
16:00
And I remember watching that commercial
16:02
and thinking to myself,
16:03
"Why is this dog talking like that?"
16:08
Right? Why is this dog talking
16:10
like the deep-voiced dude in Boyz 2 Men?
16:14
Right? The dog-- that's not a dog.
16:15
I had a dog. If my dog could talk,
16:17
she would just mostly be like, "Hey! Hey!
16:19
Who's at the door?
16:21
I love you! Who's at the door?
16:23
You cooking? Who's at the door?
16:25
All right, I'ma go eat your roommate's tampons.
16:29
I don't know why I do it, I just do it.
16:30
I'm not a sophisticated animal.
16:32
I certainly can't tell changes in your behavior.
16:35
Who is at the door?"
16:46
The worst-- this was the worst,
16:48
when they, uh-- they started targeting DARE commercials
16:51
specifically at black people.
16:53
Perhaps this predominantly-white audience also remembers that.
17:00
They did the same thing with all of our commercials.
17:02
Y'all know it, you know. They add hip-hop.
17:06
That's always our commercial.
17:07
It's the same commercial y'all get,
17:08
but then there's a ( bleep ) break dancing.
17:11
Like, "Crack? Hell nah, dawg.
17:13
Not no more."
17:17
And it's so condescending.
17:19
And it's-- I hate it, because here's why.
17:21
Because it presumes that all black people are the same,
17:24
that we're just this homogenous group
17:26
that's easily enticed by hip-hop, and we're not.
17:28
We're as diverse and complicated as any of you.
17:31
Look, one of my favorite things to do in the world,
17:33
absolute favorite things to do in the world,
17:35
I like to get myself a medium cup
17:38
of frozen yogurt, right?
17:40
Medium cu-- I'm not greedy.
17:42
A medium cup of frozen yogurt,
17:44
and I like to sit at home,
17:45
and I watch YouTube videos of people getting engaged.
17:51
- ( cheers, applause ) - Thank you.
17:53
That's my shit.
17:55
I do it for hours.
17:57
Hours of just eating yogurt and having a nice cry
18:00
and enjoying love happening.
18:02
Afterwards, I'll look myself in the mirror,
18:05
and I'll be like, "Yo, son,
18:06
you a real-ass ( bleep )."
18:08
And that's--
18:09
that's not in those commercials.
18:12
"Wipe your tears, dawg. We good.
18:15
We got a big day ahead of us."
18:19
There used to be this one DARE commercial,
18:21
right, with this little black girl, and she's reading.
18:23
This is, like, a "black" DARE commercial
18:25
meant to keep us away from drugs.
18:26
She's in the streets of New York
18:28
and she's reading this hardcore spoken word poem, right?
18:31
It's meant to scare us away, and she's walking around New York like,
18:33
"This is Trey!
18:36
This his crew.
18:38
Here he is, what he do.
18:41
Only listens, never plays.
18:43
Never think, never says
18:46
what he wants or what he needs.
18:48
Just sit right there and smoke that weed.
18:51
I wonder if he'll ever leave.
18:54
Word."
18:58
As if a bunch of ( bleep ) is gonna be sitting back like,
19:00
( inhales ) "Hey, you know what?
19:02
This little rhyming bitch is right.
19:05
Maybe we should go to college.
19:08
Feels like a hundred years of systemic racism
19:10
have been lifted off my shoulders.
19:13
Thank you, little rhyming bitch.
19:16
Thank you."
19:18
It's so ( bleep ) up, man. You know why?
19:20

19:23
Trey's not bothering anybody.
19:26
He's harmless. He's not hurting.
19:27
He's sitting and chilling on his own property,
19:30
smoking what is now a recreational drug.

19:34
but he ain't hurting nobody.

19:42
And that's the-- you want to scare me away from drugs,
19:44

19:47
some shit that really ( bleep ) up the world, right?
19:49
Like, "This is Chaz!
19:52
Chaz insider trades,
19:55
stealing homes from poor people
19:57
on the New York Stock Exchange."
19:59
( cheers, applause )
20:01
"Also, Chaz is high as ( bleep ) right now.
20:05
He does a lot of cocaine in the bathroom at work.
20:07
We would fire him, but you know, his dad. You get it.
20:12
Word."
20:14
You guys were a lot of fun, man.
20:15
My name's Langston Kerman.
20:17
