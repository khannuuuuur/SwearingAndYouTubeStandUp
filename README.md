# SwearingAndYouTubeStandup

This paper will investigate the relationship between the usage of swear words and how successful a stand-up comedy video on YouTube is. A sample of roughly 50 videos from the Comedy Central Stand-Up channel was taken. The swearing frequency and like-to-view ratio of each video was calculated. Then, these two quantities were plotted against each other to see if there was a correlation between the like-to-view ratio and the swearing frequency.

The results show that there is a weak positive correlation between swearing and the like-to-view ratio of a stand-up comedy video.
